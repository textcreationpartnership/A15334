         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F men, nay, if vve our ſelues (brethren) that profes godlines, had any, either harts to conceiue, or eies to ſee, or mouths to ſpeake, vve can not chooſe but beleue, behold and confeſſe the vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull goodnes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD tovvards this last, and yet vvorſt age of the vvorld, vvherin vve liue, he hauing plentifully poured forth vpon it, ſo many excellent and great graces, ſpecially ſpirituall, as no time heretofore hath bin indued vvith better: VVherof had vve nothing els to bear vvitnes, but that huge heap of
<pb facs="tcp:6724:3"/>light and religion, that GOD hath made to break forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, it vvere ſufficient not only to iustify &amp; approue this truth, but to condemne the vvorld of horrible ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in not thankefully receiuing, and of curſed careleſnes, either in abuſing or not profiting by ſuch ſingular fauour, ſome as vve ſee, notvvithstanding the ſun-shine of GODS bleſſed vvord, vveltring and vvallovving in the blindnes and ignorance of their ovvn harts, not knovving vvhat a pretious ievvell it is; others in prophanenes and atheiſme horribly ſcoffing and ſcorning at the ſame, notvvithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the excellency therof; others talking of it for vaine iangling, but vvithout care of obedience, polluting by a levvd life that vvhich is moſt holy of it ſelfe; otherſome making that vvhich is indeed ſpiritual, and as a man may ſay, heauenly, a ſtepping-ſtone of preferment and vvorldly glory; vvherunto being once lifted vp, they fall to fostring of pride in themſelues, and diſdainfull carping at others; ſom as ſathans ſeruants and instruments, vſing, or abuſing it rather, for the maintainance of erronious and hereticall opinions, &amp;c. So that a man may ſafly and certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that though the light of GOD be come into the vvorld, and hath indeed gloriouſly appeared amongſt vs, yet men haue loued, and daily doo affect darknes rather than light.</p>
            <p>But hovvſoeuer the strength of this impietie doo moſt plainely and plentifully appeare in the deſperate vvicked of the vvorld, the poiſon of this infection, hauing ſpread it ſelf abroad, from the very heart of the vngodly into all their veines and ſinnevvs, ſo that all the partes of their bodies, and povvers of their ſoules are polluted therevvith, yet shall vveſee, that by reaſon of the remainders of originall iniquitie, ſome stinch of the ſame hath burst foorth, euen in the ſonnes and ſeruants of God, though not to defile them
<pb facs="tcp:6724:3"/>vvith ſuch fearefull tranſgreſſions as the vvicked of the vvorlde are ouertaken vvithall, yet to hinder them from the doing of ſuch holie duties, as vvherevnto, in pietie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards GOD, and in charity tovvards men, they are (if my iudgement faile me not) ſtraitly bound, vvhilest ſome of them, conſidering mens ſetlednes in ſin, and hovv hard they are frozen in the dregs of their iniquity, and hauing fevv or no arguments of doing good, labor little or nothing at all; otherſome againe vveighing the vvorthines of gods graces, and being loth to offer the glorious mysteries of the Lord to open despite, and ſo thereby to increaſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the vvicked, doe leaue off all means almost to reclaime men from vvickednes, and to vvinne them to GOD.</p>
            <p>VVhat I vvrite novv, the godly of the land vvil vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vvith me I thinke, and the ſmall labors publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat, of men othervviſe vvell qualified, and the little fruit flovving from the ſame, vvil yeeld ſufficient proofe: yea, as I knovv by practiſe and experience in ſome, ſo I feele the ſame by aſſaults and ſuggeſtions in my ſelfe, to vvhich, though mine ovvn naturall corruption, and the vvorld of vvickednes that is vvithin me, do bid me gladly conſent, yet that poore portion of grace (I account it ſo, not as it commeth from GOD, but as it is tainted through my ſin) that God hath bin pleaſed to beſtovv vpon me, vvil hardly ſuffer me to yeeld, bicauſe I ſee no reaſon in truth, vvhy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſins, or the imperfections of GODS children ſhould vtterly diſcourage them from doing the duties that GOD hath laid vpon them, for if vve ſhould ſo doo, vve ſhould neuer perform any ſeruice to GOD, men, or our ſelues, bicauſe ther vvill be alvvays vvickednes in the vvorld, and manifold vveakneſſes and vvants, euen in the dearſt ſaints and ſeruants of GOD.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:6724:4"/>
            <p>The thing that I rather vviſh vvith all my hart, is, that euery one of vs, and my ſelfe eſpecially, in due examination of our ovvne ſouls, might through Gods great goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards vs in Chriſt, find our ſelues fit, not only in affection &amp; good vvil, but in al heuenly ſtrength &amp; ſpiritual knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo, our manifold tranſgreſſions being remoued and doone avvay, according to our meaſure of graces receiued, in this behalfe, to do good vnto many. For mine ovvn part, I vvillingly acknovvledge my ſelfe the meaneſt and the baſeſt of many my good brethren in the ministery of GOD: yea ſo far off am I from preſuming any thing as of my ſelfe, that I do aſvvell in the ſight of my ſins before GOD, and feeling vvithal of his hand of iuſtice and iudgement vpon me for the ſame, as in the acquaintance that I haue vvith mine inſufficiency ye ignorance before men (both vvhich (no doubt) may iuſtly cauſe me to be dull and heauy in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good duty) think (and ſo do vnfainedly confes) my ſelfe vnfit and vnmeet for ſuch vvorthy vvorks. And yet I cannot but lay foorth this much, that relying vppon the goodnes of the cauſe, and hoping (though it ſeeme almoſt againſt hope) that GOD vvill giue a greater bleſſing to the carefull and chriſtian labours of his ſeruants, than vve can ſee vvith the eie of fleſh and bloud, I haue bin bold to publiſh this litle treaty, vvherby, if the mouths of ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies of GOD, as bark againſt his holy truth, may in ſom ſort be ſtopped, and the comfort and inſtruction of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prouided for, I ſhall haue vvherin to reioice, as for the common good, ſo on your behalfe (my very deare friends) of vvhom I am aſvvell perſuaded as of my ſelfe, and to ſome of vvhom (I freely confes it) I ovve in Chriſt more than my ſelfe, if I could tell hovv to pay it. But not being able to perform that, and vvithall vnvvilling to continue ſtill in my vnthankefulnes (I muſt confes it) tovvards you,
<pb facs="tcp:6724:4"/>I haue thought meet novv at the length, to offer vnto you in print that vvhich I once vvrote, for the beſt and deareſt priuate friend, next vnto my naturall parents, that euer I had in this vvorld, that as GOD hath ſtirred you vp, to ſucceed him in kindnes tovvards me, ſo I might make you (as thoſe vvhom I loue much in Chriſt) partakers of thoſe poore labors and loue that I performed tovvards him. In vvhich reſpect alſo I am vvillingly content to let it come abroad to behold the light, not only deſiring you and euery of you to accept it, as a ſmall token of my vnfained good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvill, vvhich vvhen it can offer no better preſentments that it hath, but alſo praying the Lord to make it povver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to aduance his ovvne vvorke of ſaluation in his ſeruants, and of iudgement and confuſion, in all his and their obstinate enimies.</p>

For though it be true, that amongſt earthly men in worldly matters, no mans teſtimonie is to be allowed or receiued, as ſufficient proofe or witnes in his owne cauſe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that partialitie that cleaueth vnto vs, alwayes fauoring our ſelues in our owne affaires, yet in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6724:6"/>and ſpirituall things, the like courſe in deede hath no place, bicauſe that the author and giuer of the word, is free from all humane affections, and therefore the word alſo proceeding from him, muſt of neceſſitie be cleare from all parcialitie. Neither is there any cauſe or reaſon why that, if the credite of humane conſtitutions, depending partly vppon the authoritie of the law-makers, and partly vppon the goodnes, certaintie, and neceſſitie of the lawes themſelues, hauing not approbation from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, the ſame may not, yea ought not, in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and truth, to be much more forcible, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the commaundements and ſtatutes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, who both in himſelfe and in his laws alſo, is altogither voide of thoſe corruptions, that ſticke faſt to earthly lawe-makers, and their ciuill conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>Nowe amongſt the manifold teſtimonies, which are taken euen from the worde it ſelfe, this in my mind, is not of the leaſt importance, that whether it ſpeake of it ſelfe, or others, it alwayes proceedeth with an vpright foote, free from all parcialitie, and all worldly reſpects whatſoeuer. The truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it might the better appeare, euen then when it ſpeaketh of the deareſt ſaints &amp; ſeruants of God, it ſpareth not to lay out, and that without mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or minſing of their tranſgreſſions, their ſeuerall ſins committed againſt God and men, both before their calling and after their calling alſo, as Moſes his murmuring, Aaron his idolatrie, Dauid his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultry and murther, Peters denial and diſſimulation, Pauls perſecution, &amp; an infinit number of ſuch like.

Of a truth, freely to ſpeake my mind in this behalfe what I thinke; there is not to me any place, ſpecially in the bookes of the new teſtament (I except alwayes many things in the Reuelation of S.

            <p>Neyther vtter I this wyth a diſpitefull heart, to twite men for their corruption and ſins, or with the iuſt diſpraiſe of ſome, to purchaſe an vniuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to my ſelfe, or in declaring the hardnes of the word, to hunt after worldly praiſe, in the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous handling thereof (vices &amp; foule faults, that are too rife and common in the world nowadayes) but rather dutifully to ſtir vp my ſelfe, and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of God, not only in this, but in al ſuch like places whatſoeuer, to attaine, and that with vnwearied la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſtudie, to the ſound and ſincere meaning thereof. Wherevnto, bicauſe we are altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, aſwel by reaſon of the natural blindnes that is in vs before regeneration, as of the remainders of our corruption, euen after ſome meaſure of light and knowledge receiued, &amp; we know, that without ſome ſpecial grace from God, we can neuer reach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that therfore we ſhould be earneſt with the Lord by prayer, not onely, by the bright beames of his bleſſed ſpirit, to chaſe away, the darknes and dulnes of our owne vnderſtandings, but euen to induce vs after a ſort, as it were, with extraordinary iudgment and wiſedome of heart, and vtterance of mouth and words, in as much as the places which we deal with are more than ordinarily or commonly heard. The want or neglect of which duty, maketh many of vs (the Lord be mercifull vnto vs in the forgiuenes of all our ſins) to haue the worde, when it is read and taught vnto vs,<note place="margin">Iſai. 29.11.</note> to be as it were the wordes <hi>of a booke that is ſealed vp,</hi> and when we come to handle it, wee deale with it vnreuerently, as in regard of God, and vnrightly as in regard of it ſelf, and coldly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6724:10"/>as in reſpect of our ſelues, &amp; vnfruitfully alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither and vnprofitably, as in conſideration of the people: ſo that a man may ſafly ſay, &amp; that without offence either of god or good men, I aſſure you (the more is the pity) that there is little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſome of our ſermons, and the bare reading of the ignorant miniſters.</p>
            <p>But to the matter it ſelfe, in the diducting &amp; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out wherof, we wil keep this courſe, as firſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Apoſtle his general drift, &amp; purpoſe, as it were, &amp; then afterwards come more particularly to handle the very words in order as they lie, deliuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe, &amp; obſeruing ſuch doctrines out of the ſame, as it ſhal pleaſe god to make manifeſt vnto vs.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle Rom. 8. doth moſt fruitfully intreat of many notable points, &amp; namely amongſt the reſt of ſuch aſſured teſtimonies, both outward &amp; inward as god hath bin pleſed to giue to his faithful people, for the certainty of their election &amp; that eternal life of theyrs, that God hath in Chriſt laid vp for them with himſelfe, before the foundations of the worlde were laid.

            <p>Neither doth this circumſtance of our own baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vnworthineſſe, extoll the excellencie and worthineſſe of the gift, but his perſon alſo, that hath beſtowed the ſame vpon vs,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 50.1 1.

               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.37.</note> as the apoſtle himſelf ſpeaketh in the later end of this eight chapter, there being alwayes this one ſpeciall difference betwixt vs and them, that though they ouercome to day, yet they may, through the ſudden alteration, change, and inconſtancie of the thinges of this life, be ſubdued to morrow, or the next daie, as you would ſay, whereas thoſe that are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the eternall victorie that Chriſt hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt al his and our enimies, both bodilie and ſpirituall, ſhal neuer be vanquiſhed and ouercome againe. And though that our aduerſaries in their continuall malice, may attempt many matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, and perhappes now and then alſo giue vs ſome blowes and woundes, yet here is the glorie and comfort of chriſtians, that euen in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of fierie flames, and all other greuous trialles whatſoeuer, that the wicked <hi>according to the vvill of God,</hi> lay vppon vs,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>An other reaſon that the apoſtle vſeth, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort the ſaints &amp; ſeruaunts of God withal, in the daies of their diſtres &amp; greuous afflictions, is taken fi o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that glory, that we ſuffring with him, ſhall haue perfectly togither with him, when hee ſhall appeare in great power and glory, to iudge the quicke and the dead. And the force of this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is contained in theſe words, <hi>that vve may alſo be glorified vvith him:</hi> wherof there is likewiſe very good reaſon; namely, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the croſſe and chriſtian profeſſion are companions, that ſeldome or neuer are found aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in this life amongſt the children of God, the truth whereof appeareth, by the manifolde <hi>testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Gods holy vvorde,</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6724:15"/>on the other ſide, and wretched are they that are not made partakers of ſo excellent goodnes.</p>
            <p>I will ſay but this onelie, touching this point; men ſhall neuer indure with chriſtian comfort, and true patience indeede, any affliction of the fleſh, or any aſſaults of the minde (much leſſe ſhall they be able to combat and fight wyth hope of a conqueſt againſt eyther the one or the other) wythout the ſweet taſting of this, at the leaſt in ſome meaſure, or except they haue ſome goodneſſe and grace in this behalfe powred foorth vppon them from GOD: Yea ſunder this (if it could be) which is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of all, from all other the mercies of God towards vs in Chriſt, and his merits, and then what good as a man would ſay, can they do vs?

And though it be true,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note> that we might haue tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Chriſt his death, the forgiuenes of our ſins, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe his reſurrection, the imputation of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and be inabled ſo, to ſtand before God, as pure and cleane, being clothed with his holineſſe and innocencie, yet if we ſhould not come to that eternall inheritance, through the ſtrength and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his glorious aſcenſion, but liue heere vppon the earth, ſubiect to ſo many infirmities of our own, both in bodie and mind, as we continually carrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with vs, and lie open to the buffetings of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and the blowes of the wicked as his ſeruaunts (who in the rage of their ſpirites, are ready euerie

            <p>There followeth a third argument, for comforte in afflictions and troubles, euen in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this text, that wee haue now taken in hand to interprete, namely in the eighteenth verſe and theſe wordes, <hi>For I account that the afflictions of this preſent time, &amp;c.</hi> Which as it is drawn from the great oddes as you would ſay, that is betweene the pains that we indure in this world, and the eternall ioyes that are prepared for vs in the life to come, the one ſort being in it owne nature finite) as all things in this life are) though perhaps innumerable as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of vs: the other both as in reſpect of God the creator, as alſo in reſpect of it ſelfe being infinit and vnmeaſurable: ſo doth it not onely wel, but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily alſo depend euen vpon both the former reſons, and may fitly be faſtned vnto them in this ſort; that whereas he had in the former made mention part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of manifold afflictions, and partly of heauenlie glorie, now in this he laboreth to ſhew, that though our troubles and trialles bee neuer ſo great or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that yet it ſhould not any whit at all diſcourage vs, in as much as there is, a farre more excellent glorie, by infinite degrees laid vp for vs in heauen than al our ſufferings can amount vnto, whatſoeuer they be or can be, and ſo deliuereth vnto vs a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

               <hi>cauſeth vnto vs a farre most excellent and eternall vvaight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi> Yea the like ſhall we finde in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy ſcripture, all tending to teach vs, that that excellent eſtate of euerlaſting life, is deſcribed vnto vs in the word, in ſuch ſort as we may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſomewhat of it (though in trueth as in reſpect of it ſelfe, it doth far exceede al earthly, yea ſpiritual reſemblances whatſoeuer) aſwel to comfort vs ouer our heauineſſes, a matter that wee ſtand much in neede of, ſpecially if we be once truely and indeed humbled, as alſo to make vs with earneſtneſſe and feruencie, to hunger and thirſt after the ſame, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering howe much euery one of vs is ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as a man would ſay, glewed to the pleaſures and profits, of this preſent euill worlde.</p>
            <p>By al which alſo we may ſee that they are too too
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6724:18"/>iniurious to the children of God, that reſtraine the comfortable feeling of the ioies of heauen, onely to the world that is to come. True it is, that both the excellent perfection, &amp; reall poſſeſſion of the ſame is reſerued for that life, but yet that hindereth not, but that by faith and hope, wee may haue euen in this life, ſome effectuall taſte therof. And whoſoeuer thinketh otherwiſe, is not onely as much as in hym lieth, diſcomfortable to others (for what better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument haue we of ioy than that?) but hurtful and iniurious to himſelfe alſo, while he depriueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that, which of al other things, is moſt delite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſant; yea he after a ſort condemneth the ſufferings of the ſaints and ſeruants of God in time heretofore, either of folly or ſenſleſnes, who though they haue bin ſomewhat in couraged, by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the cauſes that they ſealed with their bloud, in faith and pacience to vndergo the ſame, yet haue they no doubt bin greatly furthered alſo in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, by the true taſte and feeling of thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable ioies, which haue made them, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of fierie flames, and the moſt cruell torments, that the aduerſaries could deuiſe, to be much more pacient and ioyful, than euer they were in the days of their greateſt health and proſperitie.</p>
            <p>And yet bicauſe euery delay of a thing, ſpecially, if the thing it ſelfe, be of it ſelfe excellent, and in regard thereof much deſired to, is tedious and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to the fleſh, as the apoſtle no doubt did by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that he had, of the common corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nature, &amp; the particular experience that he had in himſelf, well felt in himſelfe, he doth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe verſes following, namely, 19, 20, 21, 22,

By which the apoſtle certainly would haue vs to know and learne, not only that in reſpect of our miſeries, we haue a common lot &amp; portion, with the reſt of the creatures, but alſo that euen by their example we ſhould paciently tarry the time, that God hath ſet with himſelfe (and is not in our owne power) for our full deliuerance out of thoſe anguiſhes &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Which yet that we may the better vnderſtand it ſhall not be amiſſe in my minde, in a few wordes, to lay out the apoſtles reaſon, who as I'take it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus.</p>
            <p>All the creatures do very wel perceiue, that they are ſubiect to vanitie and corruption, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandiug hope as it were, that in good time and conuenient ſeaſon they ſhall be receiued and reſtored; therefore we alſo, though wee feele our ſelues greatly beaten downe with diuerſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yea and as it were oppreſſed and ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the ſame, ought notwithſtanding ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to beleeue, that thorow Gods godneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs in Chriſt, we ſhall not miſcarrie in this life, the Apoſtle bearing recorde vnto vs,<note place="margin">2. Cor 4.8, 9</note> 
               <hi>That though vvee are afflicted on euerie ſide, yet vvee are not in distreſſe, and though vvee be cast dovvne, yet vve perish not,</hi> but that we ſhal haue and inioy at the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6724:19"/>length, when the weariſome days of our pilgrimage ſhall be finiſhed, moſt excellent glorie and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for euermore. And no doubt, but of this the Apoſtles reaſon, there is very great &amp; good reaſon alſo, yea euen declared by the Apoſtle himſelfe, in his owne wordes: for if the creatures ſubiect to this corruption, not by their owne accord, but by Gods appointment, as a puniſhment vppon them for the ſinne of mankind, do yet notwithſtanding, that they be void of reaſon, in their kinde, and after their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as you woulde ſaye, both patiently beare that burthen, and earneſtly expect a deliueraunce from the ſame, when God will, how much more ſhoulde the faithfull doe both the one and the other, the Lorde hauing indued them not onely with reaſon, a common gift beſtowed vppon all men, but filled them after a ſort with faith alſo,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.29. 2. Theſ. 3.2.</note> a proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar grace vnto his elected ones onely, from which as from a cleare and pure fountaine, they muſt of neceſſitie flowe, in ſome meaſure, both chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, and many other good vertues likewiſe, whereof alſo there is euen this reaſon amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, that looke vpon whomſoeuer GOD hath beſtowed ſtore of anie of his graces, either bodilie or ſpirituall, that euen at their handes hee looketh for a more liberal and plentiful yeeld, than of thoſe, with whome he hath not dealt, in ſo great a larges of his mercie, the varietie of graces alſo, that God hath beſtowed vpon men, ſpecially good men, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſame at their handes. For to what end elſe hath God giuen the ſame, but that in the lawful and liberall vſe of them, the giuer principallie might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more glorie, and the vſer more comfort and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6724:19"/>profite, and others alſo reape great good by them, not onelie in this life, but in the life to come.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, as you ſee, wee haue beene occupied principally, and I hope not vprofitably alſo, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Apoſtles generall drift: out of which thogh we may indeed, in ſome meaſure vnderſtand, the true and naturall ſenſe of theſe wordes, and ſo perhaps may thinke, that we neede not any further trauell; yet to the end wee may more cleerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his mind and meaning herein, and ſo receiue more ſpirituall ſweetnes from him, I will not ſpare particularly to examine the very verſes and words as they lie, braying as it were, and beating againe, and that al to peeces, the ſweete perfumes, that ſo we may haue all our ſenſes ſeized, and wholie taken vp, not only with the wholeſome, but with the moſt pleaſant and delightfull ſmell thereof (I meane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually) that is to ſay, that ſo wee may come at the length, to the full meaning thereof, and to the fitte obſeruation of ſuch profitable doctrines as do ariſe, and may rightly be gathered out of the ſame.</p>

            <p>The very word wherewith the apoſtle beginneth this verſe, being a particle cauſall, as wee vſe to ſay, doth ſufficiently proue, that it is a reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, or things before going, of which, bicauſe we haue ſpoken ſufficient already, wee ſhall not nowe neede to ſtand much vpon it here.</p>
            <p>And when the Apoſtle ſaith (I) hee meaneth it not of himſelfe onely; for it is the common iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and beleefe of all the faithfull, and the whole church of God alſo, who being inlightned by the ſame ſpirite, either be of that minde togither wyth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6724:20"/>him, or ſhould ſo be, bicauſe in this point, he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not by his own light, but according to the truth and power of the ſpirit. Neither yet doth he ſpeake it of himſelfe, as of a natural man, for the thing that he vttreth is far beyond nature, yea altogither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſame; for what worldly wiſe naturall minded man, can either ſee in afflictions, the glory that the ſons and ſeruants of God behold and fal in the ſame, or elſe can oppoſe the incomprehenſible ioys of eternall life, againſt thoſe exceeding hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and great diſtreſſes? They rather ſuppoſe all thinges to be directed by ſecondarie cauſes, or to ſpeake as they themſelues ſay, by the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or direction of fortune, who indeede are ſo far off, from perceiuing theſe heauenly ioys and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that they are carried away with conceits, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vſe vnlawfull meanes, to free them from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, or elſe fearfully fall into all muttering and repining againſt God, or to all impaciencie before men, the reaſon is, bicauſe they are not acquainted with the comforts of Gods children, nor haue no feeling of the ioys of the life that is to come. Alas, alas, they knowe not indeede, what either the one or the other meaneth:<note place="margin">1.

            </p>
            <p>Out of all which laide togither, wee may learne ſundry good leſſons; as firſt, that howſoeuer we do either for the expreſſing of our own feelings, or the better fructifieng of the word in the hearts of thoſe to whom it is directed, ſpeake particularlie of our ſelues, or as it might ſeeme in our owne names, yet
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6724:20"/>that we neuer ſwarue from that trueth of doctrine, that is commended vnro vs in the word written, &amp; is ſealed vp in our harts, by the pledge of the ſpirit, and is approoued by the common conſent of the church of God. The neglect of this, ſpecially whileſt men go about to magnifie their owne perſons, and opinions, hath beene the meane heretofore of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hereſies, ſects, and errors in the church of God, and may bring foorth the ſame bitter fruits hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except it pleaſed God to giue men better grace to looke vnto themſelues.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it teacheth vs, that ſo ſoone as God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to lay vpon vs, his rods and croſſes of trial, that then we ſhould learne, not only in the ſpirit of patience &amp; comfort to ſubmit our ſelues vnder his mighty hand, but with alferuency of praier, to craue the clearing of our vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">Iames 1.5.</note> and <hi>all holy vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome alſo,</hi> as S. Iames calleth it, that we may both ſee his ways in his works, &amp; learne to eſpie out and feel the conſolations and comforts, that he hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for vs, that ſo wee ſincke not downe vnder the burthen of our calamities, but be raiſed vp rather to al feeling hope. A point that we had neede to ſtriue vnto, by al holy meanes poſſible, aſwell by reaſon of the blindnes &amp; blockiſhnes of our own nature, and the diffidence and diſtruſt of our own hearts, as alſo bicauſe of Satans continuall malice, who laboureth at all times, but ſpecially in the days of our greateſt heauineſſe, our moſt fearefull deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And whereas the apoſtle ſaith (I count) he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that he commeth with an vpright iudgement, in an euen pair of balance &amp; ſcales, as it wer, hauing rightly &amp; religioſly examined reſons on both ſides,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6724:21"/>and gathering all into a iuſt ſumme, to weigh the troubles of this worlde, and the ioies of heauen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, not dealing therein as either the worldlie man doth, who regardeth nothing but his miſeries and afflictions, by meanes whereof he becommeth not onely impacient and waiward, but paſt all hope of admitting comfort and conſolation, nor playing the part of the prophane and inſenſible Stoiks, who againe on the other ſide, by reaſon of their beaſtlie blockiſhnes, that they get vnto themſelues, hauing both their ſoules and bodies benummed as it were, are no whit at all touched with the ſenſe of the ſame; nor yet being ſo rapt and rauiſhed with theſe eternall ioyes, that they vtterly forget, or feele not at all the miſeries and afflictions of this life, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the contemplatiue perſons, in their traun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, dreames, and reuelations, make the height and top of all perfection in this world, but as wiſe phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yea as good chriſtians, intermingling ſweet things and ſowre things togither, and comparing one of them ſo with an other, that as they ſee in their afflictions, an euident patterne of the miſerie &amp; mortalitie of their own liues, and a plaine proofe of the iuſtice and iudgement of God againſt ſinne, ſo they make the ſame a profitable meane to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not onely in a chriſtian and comfortable death, but in an holy life alſo, ſo long as GOD will haue them to liue vppon the face of the earth, to meete wyth the Lorde, and to glorify his moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed name.</p>
            <p>And this doth teach vs, vprightly to weigh and to examine, as all things generally, ſo ſpecially and particularly ſpirituall points. Which indeede, by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6724:21"/>reaſon that they be more excellent, than bodilie matters, and in that reſpect alſo, in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more remooued from our comprehenſion than the reſt, had therefore neede moſt deepelie to be looked into, for though by the line and light of our reaſon, we may be ſomewhat holpen to wade into worldly things, yet in matters of faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we cannot, not only not perſe any thing at all, by the light &amp; ſight of our owne vnderſtanding, but ſhall be much hurt and hindered thereby from the ſame, if wee yeelde to followe it; yea many times, euen in the things of this life, wee are ſo blockiſh &amp; deuoide of iudgement, that what by reaſon of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours caſt vppon worldlie thinges, and what by the blindneſſe and ignorance of our owne heart on the one ſide, and the parcialitie that is in vs on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; yea after that we ſee the truth manifeſted, ſpecially if it concerne our ſelues, or others, that we affect as our ſelues, <hi>vve call good euill and euill good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 5.20.

Howe much more eaſly then may we be ouertaken, in blind, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and partiall iudgement, as in reſpect of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cauſes. The conſideration whereof, ſhoulde not onelie make vs wary and watchefull ouer our ſelues, ſuſpecting continually our ſlipperineſſe into this ſinne, but ſhould prouoke vs alſo to labour to attaine, by al pains poſſible, the true light and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie iudgement; which indeede is not elſe-where to be had or found, but in the onelie will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in his word, as wherein alone conſiſteth,<note place="margin">Ierem 5.9, Deut 4.6.</note> all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6724:22"/>our true wiſdome and vnderſtanding whatſouer.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>That the afflictions of this preſent time]</hi> The word afflictions importeth, al the troubles and calamities that Gods children do ſuffer in this life, whether they be outward in body, as ſickenes, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, nakednes, baniſhment, perſecution, and ſuch like, or whether they be inward in the mind, as te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from our corrupted nature, aſſaults from Satans malice, griefe of hart for ſin, feare of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this life, or in that that is to come, &amp; al the reſt of that ſort whatſoeuer. And yet he reſtraineth as it wer, that generall terme, by theſe words folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he calleth them, <hi>the afflictions of this preſent time,</hi> mening, that longer than this life they laſt not, neither indeed can laſt in the children of God, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by our death, God doth not only wipe al teares from our eies, endeth our miſeries, &amp; vtterly killeth the ſtrength and body of ſin, but not leauing there,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>This rather is the Apoſtles minde, to oppoſe, as wee may plainelie perceiue, the afflictions of this worlde, againſt the ioys of the other life, and that in a double antitheſis or compariſon as it were.

               </note> as <hi>no affliction for the time preſent is ioyous, but greuous rather,</hi> the other being very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and ſweete, which though it be delaied for a while, is yet ſufficient to comfort Gods children, for the time preſent, and to confirme them in the hope that is to come. Secondly, oppoſing this time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with that that is to come, meaning by both thoſe times, the ſeuerall ſtates and condicions, that then the children of God ſhal be partakers of, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this alſo euen to comfort ſuch as fuffer in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that their afflictions ſhal laſt no longer, at the furtheſt, than their naturall life, but their ioys and glorie, ſhall be beyond and wythout all time, euen for euer and euer.</p>
            <p>And euen out of theſe wordes wee may gather a ſingular comfort againſt afflictions, to wit, that though they be many times great and greeuous, yet they are not alwayes long and continuall.

            <p>The Apoſtle addeth, are <hi>not vvorthie of the glorie,</hi> his meaning in this place, and in theſe wordes, is in my minde plaine and ſimple, who doth not heere compare the dignitie and woorthineſſe eyther of our ſufferings, or of eternall glorie togither, as ſome haue phantaſticallie conceiued, and more wickedly propounded, but laboureth to mitigate the greatneſſe of our afflictions, by oppoſing and ſetting againſt the ſame the greatneſſe, yea the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſſe of that ioy and glorie, that is laide vp for

And though this be moſt true, yet notwithſtanding Sathan, in ſeuerall ſortes of hys ſeruants, as in the ſchoole-men heeretofore, hath out of this place gone about to maintaine that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelliſh diſtinction, of <hi>meritum congrui &amp; condigni,</hi> as they call it, and in our Romiſh Rhemiſts alſo, in their late annotations vppon the newe Teſtament, and namely vpon this very place, woulde make the ſufferings of the ſaints in this life, meritorious and worthie of eternall ſaluation.

And if this courſe may be kept, that compounde wordes may be vſed for ſinople wordes, wee ſhall quickly turne vpſide downe all certaintie of the written worde, all trueth of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and all honeſt and faithful dealing amongſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6724:24"/>men. All the Greeke copies that euer I coulde ſee, reade it in the ſimple, and ſo doeth Saint Ignatius himſelfe alleage it, in his epiſtle to Marie; and it is the firſt epiſtle in his booke of epiſtles, yea and their owne Arrius Montanus, a man of leſſe corruption (I had almoſt ſaid, more vprightnes) in tranſlating the worde than they all, though otherwiſe popiſh, conuicted by the euidence and trueth of this point, rendreth it rightly in his interlineall text, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer for faſhion ſake he ſet the vulgar reading in the margine.

And in his fift booke of the citie of God, chap. 18. where he doth of purpoſe ſhewe, how farre off chriſtians ought to be from boaſting, if they had doone any thing for loue of the eternall countrie, hee alleadgeth euen this very text of the Apoſtle thus: <hi>Ind gnae ſunt paſſiones huius temporis, &amp;c.</hi> The ſufferings of this time are vnworthie the glorie which ſhall be reuealed in vs. And ſo doth ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ancient fathers tranſlate it, as if I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in multitude of allegations, I could eaſly ſhew. By whith we may not onely ſee, the true and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meaning of the Apoſtle in this text, that is to debaſe our ſinterings, and to magnifie eternal life, but alſo that that vulgar tranſlation, is not either ſo olde as they pretende, or elſe was not in thoſe dayes of ſitche credite, as they woulde haue it nowe, in as much as we ſee the auncient fathers, either vſing ſome other, or ſwaruing greatly from that.</p>
            <p>And no doubt but as the ſpring is puddlelie and

For as for God, his mercie is greatly obſcured (if not vtterly euacuated and diſanulled) by this, in as much as mans ſuppoſed merits and deſerts (which indeede are nothing but death and damnation) are not onely matched wyth the ſame, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and diſcontinuance thereof, there being as great oddes betweene them, as betweene the moſt glorious thing of the worlde, and the filthieſt durt or dung that can be, but after a ſort preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and that not only in the eies of men (a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſhould make vs all to bluſh, and hang down our heads for ſhame) but (if it might be accepted for currant coine and lawfull paiment) tendred at the exchequor of the moſt high king, yea brought foorth into the verie ſight and preſence, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and alleadged at no woorſe barre, than at the very throne and iudgement ſeat of almightie God himſelfe.</p>

            <p>But to come more particularly to the points themſelues indeede.

            <p>By <hi>meritum congrui,</hi> or deſert of congruence, as you would ſay, they vnderſtand ſuch workes, as doe not of their owne nature, truly and indeed deſerue ſaluation, otherwiſe than as it hath pleaſed God of ſome certaine goodnes in himſelfe, to promiſe the ſame thereto: and of this ſort they will haue all morall actions to be, ſpecially ſuch as are done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore regeneration and iuſtification.</p>
            <p>And by <hi>meritum condigni,</hi> that is, deſert of woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, they meane ſuch works, as to which there is wholy and altogither a reward due, not ſo much by reaſon of the gracious promiſes of god, as in reſpect of the acts or deedes doone; and of this ſort they make the workes of the godly after regeneration.</p>
            <p>But for anſwere, both to the tearmes and matter we ſay, that neither the wordes of this diſtinction, nor the diſtinction it ſelfe, nor the matter meant vnder the diſtinction, is contained in the canonicall ſcriptures, but rather all is ouerthrowne thereby, as ſhal hereafter plainely appeare.</p>
            <p>True it is, that their vulgar Latine hath in diuers places thruſt in a Latin worde that ſignifieth to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or deſerue, but without any warrant of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

Wherewith alſo Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine that ancient doctor of the church, euen allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Thomas of Aquine himſelfe, <hi>Quest. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>De gratia Christi. artic.</hi> 6. <hi>in concluſ.</hi> very well agreeth, who proueth againſt the Pelagians, that grace can not fall vnder merit, becauſe that before grace, there are no deſerts, but ſuch as are euill, bicauſe a man before grace receiued is wicked, &amp; to wicked mens merits, not grace, but puniſhment is due.

By which alſo we may ſee that it was the vniforme iudgement of this holy doctor.</p>
            <p>And if this doctrine of merit of congruence may be admitted for true, I ſee no reaſon why wee may not with Origen holde, that al men at the leaſt ſhal be ſaued, ſith there haue none liued ſo beaſtly or prophanely, but they haue had not care alone to performe, but haue indeede performed morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for which, though not as in regarde of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet as in reſpect of GODS promiſes, they might claime eternall life by this popiſh aſſertion.</p>
            <p>But it may be, that they will except againſt this, the poore infidelles and idolatrous people of the world, bicauſe they were neuer yet well acquainted with the promiſes of God. Be it ſo, bicauſe I ſuppoſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6724:27"/>they dare not holde, that mens morall deedes may merit without relation had to Gods gratious and great promiſes. But put the caſe of thoſe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outwardly gathered into the boſome or lap of the church, or made partakers at the leaſt in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hearing of the graces and mercies of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed vnto the ſame: tell vs, whether they may be, in any better ſtate and condition by this your doctrine. If you will affirme it, the euidence of truth exclaimeth againſt you, bicauſe it is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to hold, that the promiſes of themſelues without application of them to mens harts &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, ſhoulde effect that worke for them. You might before men aſwell maintaine, that maimes and woundes might be cured wythout medicine and ſalue, or a naturall life vpheld wythout meate, drinke, ſleepe, and ſuch like, as defend that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, wythout application of them to our ſoules, may become effectuall vnto men, bicauſe they indeede be, the only plaiſters of our ſoules, &amp; the only ſpirituall foode vnto our ſoules. Neither is this vttered to weaken the excellencie and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Gods promiſes, either as in regarde of God the promiſe-maker, or as in regarde of the thinges promiſed, for ſo they be alwayes good, holie, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, powerfull, and what not? Neither were it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit, that the worthines thereof ſhoulde depende vpon our apprehenſion &amp; application of the ſame, for that were to ſubiect GOD and moſt excellent things, to vs that be moſt baſe and vile, but ſpoken as in conſideration of men, to whome they ought to be applied, for want whereof alſo it falleth out, that they are become a dead letter or vnprofitable
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6724:28"/>word to them, tending almoſt to no other ende, but to magnifie and manifeſt, the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, with greater griefe vnto our owne ſoules, in as much as we ſee moſt excellent things offered vs, &amp; yet cannot finde or feele, that wee haue anie parte or portion therein.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, as touching workes done after rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, wee freelie confeſſe, that though at the firſt bluſh they may ſeeme very glorious, yea, and be indeede and trueth good, ſpecially as they come from GOD, and be wrought in vs by the ſpirite of Chriſt that dwelleth in our harts: yet as they come from vs, and be tainted with the remainders of our corruption, they are ſo farre off from meriting or deſeruing before God, that if he do indeed examine and weigh them, in the moſt notable exactnes and vprightnes of his iuſtice, he ſhall always finde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough in them, not onelie to reiect the things themſelues, though otherwiſe well doone, but alſo to condemne vs the workers thereof, and that not onelie for the imperfections and wants, that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto them, we aſſuring our ſelues by the truth of chriſtian religion, that no imperfect thing can of it ſelfe pleaſe him, that is moſt perfect, but euen for our natural filthines and corruption, that clingeth and ſticketh as faſt thereto, as the skin to the fleſh, or the fleſh to the bones.</p>
            <p>And for the proofe of this point, wee haue two plaine places of holie Scripture amongſt manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one taken out of the olde Teſtament, the other out of the newe, that ſo alſo in alleadging them, and comparing one of them with an other, wee may ſee the moſt comelie conformitie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6724:28"/>that is in thoſe moſt excellent writings of the ſpirite of God.</p>
            <p>The prophet Iſaiah, in the three ſcore and fourth chapter of the booke of his viſions, and in the ſixt verſe of the ſame chapter, ſpeaking to the Lord in his owne name, and in the name of the reſt of the people of God, ſiath,<note place="margin">Iſai. 64.6.</note> that <hi>vvee haue all beene as an vncleane thing, and all our righteouſnes as filthie clovvts.</hi> In which ſentence certainly, there is neuer a word wanting weight, for the proofe of the particular point for which it is brought foorth, ſpeciallie if we looke vppon it, as it is in the originall text; for firſt he ſaith not all men generallie, which yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſome might ſeeme ſtrange, bicauſe of that fond conceit. that hath crept into mens mindes, that all men are not alike tainted in Adam, but all we, me aning all the faithfull and elect people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding alſo himſelfe (though otherwiſe a very holy &amp; godlie man) in the number: which yet is more ſtrong, if we conſider that this that the prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth, is not onely the common caſe of all the faithfull, but euen of the beſt ſort of them (if any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them be better than other) ſo that if there were any to be excepted, they moſt chefly, &amp; rather than others, and yet notwithſtanding, God by the prophet wrappeth and foldeth them vppe togither (not excepting any one, of, or amongſt, them all) as filthy and vncleane, by meanes wherof alſo, they deſerued ſeparation from God &amp; men, filthy &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane things not being vſed, as we ſee by the truth of the word, either for gods ſeruice, or about co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon affaires till ſuch time as they were purified, yea we knowing further by the lawe, that they did not only
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6724:29"/>carry the note of pollution,<note place="margin">Leoit. 11.39.</note> and vncleanneſſe in themſelues, but tainted ſuch others therewyth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (if they came nigh thereto) as touched the ſame: our ſtate and condition, being wholie and altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like vnto the ſame, by reaſon of the worlde of wickedneſſe that reſteth in vs, wee hauing defiled by meanes of our ſins not our ſelues onely, but the reſt of the creatures,<note place="margin">Zeph. 1.3. Iob 15.15.</note> 
               <hi>Yea the very heauens</hi> thereby are after a ſort become <hi>impure and vncleane in Gods ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet the Prophet ſtaieth not there, but as though he could finde neither wordes nor matter, ſufficient inough to deſcribe our naughtineſſe by, he addeth further, <hi>all our righteouſnes,</hi> or as it is in the Hebrew text, <hi>righteouſneſſes,</hi> it being a worde of the plurall number, he meaning alſo thereby, and that according to the proprietie of that toong, which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuch wordes both to note number and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, that all and euery grace, howe many and howe notable ſoeuer they be, or can be in this life, are not (though not as of themſelues, nor as they come from God, for ſo they are alwaies, and muſt needes continually be good) yet as they are tainted with the corruption of our nature, and by reaſon of our imperfection and defects, ſuch as may come into accounts before God, in the exactneſſe of his righteouſneſſe. By which alſo we may well perceiue and learne, that neither the glorie and glittering, nor the number of our good workes, are, or can be ſuch (ſpecially as they proceede from vs) as may commend vs to GOD, much leſſe merite at his handes of themſelues &amp; for themſelues, but as they are accepted before him, in and for an others ſake
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6724:29"/>onely: without the which indeede, they are rather matters of abhomination before God.</p>
            <p>And that the truth of this, might yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, the prophet compareth them, not to things meanely, baſe, filthy, and vile, but either to the defiled clowts of a monſtrous woman, as their owne vulgate turneth it; or to the clowts occupied about them that be ſicke and diſeaſed, which Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus calleth <hi>patientium,</hi> according to the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians phraſe, but it ſhoulde be, as I thinke, <hi>parienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> rather, that is, of them that bring foorth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the worlde: or as Aquila turneth it, the clowts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4+ letters">

               </gap>tneſſes,<note place="margin">Deue, 22.15</note> meaning thereby ſuch ſignes &amp; tokens as were giuen of virginitie, in the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the marriage bed; or like vnto a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched garment made of peeces and ſhreads of verie olde and ouer-worne cloths, as Dauid, Kmichi, and ſome other of the Iewiſh rabbins will haue it: or as Ionathan in his Thargum expoundeth it, as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect garment, or a garment that for the filthines of it, is fit to be floong from vs; all and euery one of theſe, noting ſuch things, as both eie and heart ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth. And in truth, if herein a man ſhould ſtand to alleadge, the ſeuerall interpretations, that men haue giuen of that word, we might quickly grow te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious: a matter that I for mine own part like not of, neither indeed would I therein haue bin ſo large at this preſent, but that al men might ſee, both Iewiſh and chriſtian expoſitors, concurring as it were, and conſenting togither, to reſemble our beſt things, to moſt baſe and vile matters, yea to ſuch things as are lothſome to be looked on, and greuous many times to be thought of, ſo far off haue they bin from euer
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6724:30"/>approuing or allowing the merit of mans workes before God, and ſpeciallie as in reſpect of eternall life and ſaluation.</p>
            <p>And leaſt any man ſhould thinke, that this were but the voice of a mortall man obſcurely and darkly vttered in the olde Teſtament, touching this point, let vs heare what the eternal ſon of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall father (who neither deceiueth nor is deceiued) hath vnder the goſpell in a moſt audible voice ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning this matter, that ſo wee may the more readily receiue the trueth, and deteſt al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary falſhoode whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>In the ſeuenth of Luke hee teacheth vs, both by ſimilitude and plaine doctrine,<note place="margin">Luke 17.10.</note> to confes, that <hi>vvee are vnprofitable ſeruants, euen then vvhen vve haue done the things that are commaunded vs to doe, vve hauing performed no more but that vvhich vve ought:</hi> not that Chriſt meaneth thereby, that it is poſſible for vs poore and miſerable men that wee are, to fulfill the lawe of God, and to obey all and euery one of his holie commaundements, as ſome woulde corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude therevpon, for that doctrine is altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to the trueth of the written worde, as appeareth Acts 15.10. and Rom. 8.3. and tendeth maruellouſly to puffe vp fleſh and blood. Neither yet that hee woulde teach vs in a certaine kinde of monkiſh humility, to conceiue or ſpeake more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly of our dooings, than they of themſelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, for that were dalliance, hypocriſie, and falſe witnes-bearing: beſides that, it were a robbing of God of his glory, who is then defaced, when his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; good works are debaſed beyond meaſure and trueth. And what a fearefull thing were it alſo, to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6724:30"/>make our ſauiour a teacher of ſuch vanitie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, we therby ſubiecting himſelfe to ſinne, who was altogither free from ſin, &amp; by that means like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpoiling our ſelues of al grace, goodnes, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But rather to teach vs, that though we had exactly and in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie point, kept the whole law of God (which indeed no man as man hath euer performed or can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, I alwaies except Chriſt Ieſus God &amp; man in one perſon) that yet we ſhould be ſo farre off, from thinking or dreaming of deſertes, ſpecially at Gods hands that we ſhould not, as our ſauior Chriſt ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, by the ſimilitude and plain words of the ſame, ſo much as looke for thanks, much leſſe for merit.</p>
            <p>And that we may yet more plainly perceiue this point, let vs a little weigh euen our ſauiour Chriſts owne words. He telleth vs, that though earthlie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants performe to their earthly maiſters al the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that they lay vpon them, that yet their maiſters wil not for all that, ſo much as in wordes giue them thankes for the thinges doone? Which matter beeing expreſſed in ſuche a manner as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our deliuereth it wythall, doth yet ſerue more to explane and prooue the point, hee not ſimplie affirming, that the maiſter in the accompliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeruices preſcribed, dooth not yeelde the ſeruaunt thankes, but interrogatiuely ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it ſaieth: <hi>Dooth hee giue that ſeruaunt thankes, for dooing the thing vvhich hee commaunded him?</hi> as

And yet our Sauior adding an anſwere to that queſtion, and in theſe words, <hi>I trovve not,</hi> vehemently affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no maiſter vſeth it, doeth more and more therby confirme and ſtrengthen the matter he had in hand, which is the vtter aboliſhing of all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of merit; for if earthlie ſeruaunts doe not then deſerue, at their earthlie maiſters handes, ſo much as thankes, much leſſe a reward (which all men will confeſſe, to be greater and more, in as much as workes excell wordes, the one alſo being more eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and with leſſe coſt perfourmed, than the other) when they haue accompliſhed the things that their lords and maiſters inioyed them, how can we hope or looke for, either thanks or merit, at the hands of our heauenlie father, in the performance of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſeruices, the thinking, knowing, and doing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is not onelie much more difficult and hard, than the doing of worldlie duties (by how much ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things be more excellent than worldlie) but alſo bicauſe the things themſelues, though they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, do by reſon of defects cleauing vnto them, throgh our corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (we failing either in the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, maner, end, or ſome ſuch other point) become as it were diſpleaſing in the ſight of almightie God.</p>
            <p>Is there any man ſo ſottiſh, that will denie the truth of this point? If they be, I doubt not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch, that in the blindnes of their owne heartes, they regarde not the great oddes, that both in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and authoritie, is betwene our heanenly Lord, and our earthly maiſters, nor weigh the wonderful difference, that is betwene their ſeuerall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6724:31"/>neither yet conſider their owne weakenes and wants. For firſt God as the creator of al things is infinit, &amp; man as his creature is infinit &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptible. God againe is ſpirituall &amp; heuenlie, man on the other ſide is corporal and earthly. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then no proportion betweene finite and infinit, ſpirituall and corporall, earthly and heauenly, how can men exactly &amp; abſolutely performe the infinite and ſpirituall duties, that ſuch an infinite and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall maieſtie preſcribeth? And if they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all, but faile in the moſt, or any one, how can they claime of duty? Much more maruellous is it, that they dare chalenge of deſert. On the other ſide, if we compare man to man, we ſhal then eaſlie perceiue, that howſoeuer they differ ſomewhat, as in reſpect of their ſeuerall places and callings: yet one God <hi>hath made all of that kinde of one bloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17.26.</note> 
               <hi>euen to dvvell vpon the face of the earth:</hi> and therefore there being by that meanes, not onelie a certaine ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or likenes betweene them, but equalitie after a ſort, they may, yea doe many times, more readilie yeelde to the things or duties that one of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth of an other, or the chiefeſt of them all, at the handes of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>And if wee looke vppon the difference of either of their lawes, we ſhall yet more plainely beholde, &amp; as a man would ſay, haue all our ſenſes ſatisfied in the truth of this point. For as touching the lawes we knowe by experience, and beleeue in faith, that they are ſuch, as the law-makers themſelues are: GOD therefore being ſpirituall, his alſo are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, requiring inward and moſt excellent things, whereas man being bodilie and outward, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6724:32"/>by his law, but outward and bodily obedience. To this latter, we are and may be much holpen, by the ripenes of our wits, the actiuitie and nimblenes of our bodies, the light of nature, continuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, daily exerciſe, and many ſuch like. But to the former, nothing neither without vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within vs (till GOD hath quite and cleane al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vs) can any manner of way further vs, but hinder vs rather,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.14</note> 
               <hi>bicauſe the naturall man</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telleth vs) <hi>perceiueth not the things of the ſpirit of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> And againe in an other place, <hi>That the vviſedome of the flesh</hi> (meaning thereby whatſoeuer is moſt excellent in it, as of it ſelfe) <hi>is enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, for it is not ſubiect to the lavve of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeede can be.</hi> And therefore good reaſon haue we why we ſhould refuſe theſe dotages &amp; conceits.</p>
            <p>Now then to conclude this controuerſie; if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our workes before regeneration nor after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, are able to purchaſe any good thing from God, as wee haue alreadie ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſame: and wee haue no workes at all, but they muſt of neceſſitie be compriſed, vnder the one or the other number of this diuiſion; then it plainely and truely followeth heerevpon, that no deedes of ours whatſoeuer, doe or can merite or deſerue any good thing at Gods handes, much leſſe eternall life, the chiefeſt good of all; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent alſo, that theſe popiſh diſtinctions are both blinde and blaſphemous.</p>
            <p>Nether are theſe things ſpoken, as to cracke the credit of the good workes, that God inableth his children to do (for what are we miſerable wretches, that we ſhould debaſe or deface his graces, in our
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6724:32"/>ſelues or others) or to diſcorage men from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſame (whom we ought and that by the warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the word &amp; chriſtian charitie,<note place="margin">Hebr. 3.13.</note> to draw on by al means poſſible to the dooing of them) but rather to teach vs willingly, to take ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of face vpon our ſelues, by reaſon of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; defects that cleueth to our good deeds, that ſo God in our debaſing may receiue all glorie of goodnes, to whom indeed &amp; alone it belongeth: yea and ſo to profit by theſe our wants &amp; weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that it may appeare both to our ſelues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that we haue not receiued, the truth of this doctrine in vaine, but referred it to the right endes, the Lorde vſing it not onely as a notable meane to humble vs before him, in whoſe ſight all fleſh muſt ſtoupe and be abaſed, how righteous &amp; innocent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they ſeeme to be before men, but alſo to cauſe vs with more ſpeede and earneſtnes to looke vp to Chriſt, and to repaire to him that is the only meane to cure our tranſgreſſions, &amp; to couer al our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections whatſoeuer, which of a truth none perform that any maner of way (how little or much ſoeuer it be) will plead merit or deſert, in Gods ſight, ſetting vp notwithſtanding before vs,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.1.</note> 
               <hi>Perfection</hi> as a butte or marke to aime at, though we cannot hit it, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to it in this life, making notwithſtanding our care and conſcience to appeare, in a lawful ſtriuing toward it, as much as we may, alwayes aſſuring our ſelues of this, that God continually accepteth thoſe that are his, in his welbeloued ſon, &amp; their onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Chriſt, <hi>According to that they haue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.12.</note> 
               <hi>and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that they haue not.</hi> And let this ſuffice for a iuſt confutation of their conceit, or dotage of deſerts.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:6724:33"/>
            <p>Nowe we come to our Rhemiſts, and their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; al that they ſay being of trueth, ſcarſe worth the anſwering, neither indeed neede we to trauell in it, were it not, leaſt they ſhould waxe inſolent, in the fond imaginations of their hearts, or ſhould thorow their owne corruption cary men headlong thorow the blindneſſe of their vnderſtandings, to error and hereſie.</p>
            <p>They tell vs in their notes here, that we dare not much aduouch, that Chriſts paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be not merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of his glorie. To which we anſwere, that what we dare aduouch concerning Chriſts paſſions, they doe not well knowe, bicauſe they will not, or dare not be acquainted with our doctrine and writings, abſenting themſelues from our publike aſſemblies, and forbidding all of their faction (ſome fewe onlie excepted) to read our works. If wee dare not much aduouch Chriſts ſufferings not to be meritorious, is there anie maruell, ſith it is a doctrine neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the word, nor deliuered by the fathers of right faith and religion? Papiſtes thinke that all aſſertions are to be reiected, that are not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted either by the ſcriptures, or by the conſent and authoritie of reuerend antiquitie. And why may not we then vppon the ſame groundes, refuſe this concluſion, ſith it hath not for it ſuch proppes and foundations? And if wee dare not aduouch much, againſt the merites of Chriſts ſufferings, as they ſay, why do they here, and elſe-where in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places labour largely to confute that, that is ſo fearfully affirmed, and namely Philip. 2. where they ſay, that we wickedly and vnlearnedly deny Chriſt, to haue deſerued for himſelfe. Belike our doctrine
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6724:33"/>hath bitten them by the heart, or elſe they woulde not make ſo long and often Apologies, in ſo bad &amp; deſparate cauſes. Surely, one of theſe two muſt of neceſſitie follow, either, that in vaine imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they doe fight againſt their owne ſhadowes, a point of extreame follie, ſpecially if wee dare not, or do not affirme that which they ſay we holde: or elſe vtter groſſe contradictions in themſelues, who in other places as before, charge vs wickedly &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnedly to defend the ſame that they impugne.</p>
            <p>But to the point, we for our parts feare not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expreſſe, and that to the eies and eares of all the godlie (yea to the wicked themſelues, that ſo they may be either conuerted or confounded by the glorie of truth) what wee holde and maintaine herein; firſt, that this point of doctrine propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them, is not crowned with the glorious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of holie truth, and reuerend antiquitie. For proofe whereof we bid them ſhew vs, if they can, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plaine text of ſcripture, or formall place out of the vncounterfeited writings of the ſound fathers. Thoſe that haue bin produced we haue looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finde them very vnſauerly alleadged at the leaſt: and if they haue none more pregnant and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie than they, we tell them they are ouerfeeble for vs to faſten our faith vpon. And if they ſend vs to Peter Lombard, Thomas of Aquine, and the reſt of the ſchoole doctors, that doe more curiouſly than chriſtianly wade into theſe points, we frankely and freely confeſſe, that we dare not giue them the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to be ſtampers &amp; coiners of new doctrine in the church, bicauſe wee haue learned out of the word, that <hi>there is but one only lavv-giuer, God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames 4.12.</note> 
               <hi>vvhich
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6724:34"/>is able to ſaue and to destroy,</hi> nor may not any maner of way, ſtay and ſettle our conſcience vppon them, nor vpon thoſe that be much better than they, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods worde alone, and not mans imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is the only ground and obiect therof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though wee ſhoulde graunt, that they ſpeake heerein no falſe or erronious matter, yet we affirme, that this idle and vnprofitable thought, of our owne harts and heads, ought to be aboliſhed, not only in as much as it hath no good foundation, to ſtand vpon, but alſo bicauſe it doth wonderfullie darken, if not vtterly euacuate and take away, both the loue of God, and Chriſtes grace and fauour alſo towardes vs; for we knowe and haue learned out of the ſcriptures, and therefore doe beleeue it too, that <hi>God ſo loued the vvorlde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 3 16. Rom. 8.32.</note> 
               <hi>that he gaue his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne vnto the death for vs all, to the ende that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of thoſe vvhich beleeue in him, should not perish but haue euerlasting life:</hi> which rich loue of his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, could not haue ſo plentifully and plainly appeared, if he had therein as wel prouided for his ſons profit, as for our good. And Chriſts grace can not but be greatly obſcured thereby, while we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtically imagine, that he came into the world, &amp; ſuffred al maner of villanie at the hands of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for ſome other cauſe good for himſelfe, rather than for the worke of our ſaluation. Whereas we are ſure, that when the Scripture will magnifie his loue towards vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 6.10</note> it telleth vs, that <hi>he died for vs vvhen vve vvere his vtter enimies,</hi> giuing vs thereby to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he had no regarde or conſideration of himſelfe at all, but onely of vs, yea hee himſelfe ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn 17.19</note> in the goſpell after Iohn, that <hi>for our ſakes he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6724:34"/>ſanctified himſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> by which hee plainely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that he did not onlie ſanctifie himſelfe for our ſakes alone, but alſo that he deriued, the fruit and benefit of his owne holineſſe ouer vnto vs, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nothing thereby vnto himſelfe. And no doubt but this is the meaning, as of the whole Scripture generally, ſo ſpecially of the Prophets and Apoſtles when they ſay, <hi>Vnto vs a childe is borne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>and vnto vs a ſon is giuen.</hi> And againe, that <hi>hee died for our ſins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.25</note> 
               <hi>and roſe for our righteouſnes;</hi> theſe words (vs) and (ours) being ſo emphaticall and forcible, yea after a ſort ſo particularizing the matter and perſons that they ſhew, that for vs and our ſakes onely, and for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to himſelfe, he became man, and tooke vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruant, which had it not beene wholie and altogither true, it had beene as eaſie a matter for the holie ghoſt, or holie men inſpired by the ſpirite of God, to haue ſaide, that hee did it, aſwel for himſelfe as for vs: but no ſuch phraſe can be found, and therefore hee mindeth to reſtraine Chriſtes humbling, and the fruites and effectes of it (which indeede are all his merits) wholy and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither to vs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it may ſeeme ſtraunge in reaſon to all men, if it be not erroneous in religion amongeſt Chriſtians, that the merites of Chriſtes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, ſhoulde haue a larger reach, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended further than his paſſions and ſufferings themſelues, eſpecially ſith that they themſelues make his ſufferings the cauſes of his merits, and his merits the effects of thoſe cauſes. In common ſenſe we know, that as a cauſe is before the effect, for an effect can not be before there be a cauſe working
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6724:35"/>the ſame effect: ſo it is, and muſt of neceſſitie alſo be, as large at the leaſt, as the effect it ſelfe, if not more large, in as much as it muſt not only giue life and being to the things for the preſent time produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but alſo preſerue a continuall life in it ſelf, for the bringing out of the like effectes ſtill. And they themſelues haue a rule in philoſophie; that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer worketh or bringeth foorth ſuch a thing as the thing it ſelf is, that worketh or bringeth foorth, that thing that bringeth forth is in the ſame kind; much more ſuch a thing, than that which is broght forth. Shall Chriſt then by his death merite for himſelfe? and ſhall hee not in his death die for himſelfe? But that Chriſt ſuffered for himſelfe they dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch, for the ſcripture affirmeth the contrarie, ſaying,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note> that <hi>the iust ſuffered for the vniust,</hi> and that were to make alſo Chriſt a tranſgreſſor, wheras the word telleth vs, that <hi>he did no ſinne, neither vvas there any guile found in his mouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet 2 22. Iſaiah. 53.9</note> yea it were to leaue our ſelues in our ſins, bicauſe a ſinner though he ſhould ſuffer neuer ſo much, cannot cleare himſelfe, much leſſe others from ſin, or the puniſhment due vnto the ſame. And therfore alſo there is no reaſon, why they ſhoulde holde that Chriſt merited for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Certainly, touching this point, this is my perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and I reſt reſolued, that all good men wil eaſly conſent with me in the ſame, to wit, that this forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie (that Chriſt ſuffered on the croſſe, that ſo by the merite of his worke hee might get vnto himſelfe, ſome thing which before he had not, came without all doubt euen from Sathan himſelfe, who labored by this (as by many other the like corruptions) to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6724:35"/>caſt a thicke miſt or fogge before the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent glorie and grace of our Sauiour, that ſo the ſame being dimmed at the firſt, though not in the whole, yet in ſome ſmall part of it, he might in the ende by a little taint, and diſcredite the whole. And whoſoeuer they are that ſee Sathans ſubtilties indeede, do not onely perceiue this to be moſt true, but haue their hearts alſo thorowe Gods goodneſſe inlightned to knowe, to what ende Sathan doth it, namely, to bring them, by doubting of ſome part of Chriſtes great glorie, at the leaſt to diſtruſt the whole, and ſo by conſequence to ſuffer him, yea and that willinglie alſo to hold vs captiues in vnbeleefe, at his pleaſure. We had neede therefore, not onlie to looke well about vs, leaſt we be ignorantlie, or at vnwares ſuppriſed of him in his grinnes, but alſo to hearken and that attentiuely and carefully, to the voice of the holie ghoſt, ſpeaking vnto vs in the written worde, which oftentimes telleth vs, that in Chriſts death and ſuffering, we ſhoulde not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſee, taſte, thinke, feele, or knowe any thing elſe, but Gods meere grace and goodnes onely, and ſuch great and ineſtimable loue of our Sauiour Chriſt, to vs-ward, that hee (as a man woulde ſay) quite and cleane forgetting himſelfe, and looking at nothing but our good, was contented to take his life in his hands, <hi>and vvillingly to lay it dovvne for vs all:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.17, 18</note> yea we ſhall ſee, that whenſoeuer the ſcripture ſpeaketh of the ſufferings of our ſauiour in plaine wordes and termes, it determineth that the fruit and benefit thereof redoundeth wholie and onely vnto vs, affirming, that by it, eternall life is purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto vs, and heauen gates ſet open for vs, wee
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6724:36"/>being thereby not onely purged from our filthines, but wholy reconciled to God, and reſtored to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes: for which purpoſe amongſt many other, ſee one plaine place Hebrewes 10. verſ. 14, 15, 16, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if they wil needs haue and hold, that our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt did merit for himſelfe, then let them tel vs we pray them, firſt at what time he did it, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe workes of ſuch excellencie, had a time alſo wherein they were performed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let them declare, whether in his whole perſon, or in either of his natures diſtinctly and by it ſelfe, he purchaſed that, which they ſay he meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for if we know not that, we can not tell what to beleeue, bicauſe that whatſoeuer Chriſt hath done, either for himſelfe or for vs, hee hath performed it, either in his whole perſon, or in one of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let them certainly ſhew vs, what it was, that he merited, for it is not meete that a worke of ſo great excellencie to him, and of ſuch ſingular profit to vs, as theſe men would beare the world in hande, this point bringeth with it, ſhoulde be buried vnder ſome generall knowledge of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt wee ſay, that the men, that ſo much vrge this point, haue not yet among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues certainly concluded, what time Chriſt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for as for them that tie this, to the time of his paſſion onely, or to the very act and deed of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings (of which minde our Rhemiſts ſeeme to be, both in their annotations vpon this place, &amp; in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other of their notes vpon the new Teſtament)
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6724:36"/>wee ſay, that they are not well aduiſed what they ſpeake: not only bicauſe they contradict and gaine-ſay their owne maſter of the ſentences, Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard I meane, who <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Dist.</hi> 18. affirmeth in plaine and euident termes, that Chriſt euen from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time of his conception, did by his conception deſerue that, which he did by his paſſion, but thwart alſo their angelicall doctor Thomas Aquinas, who <hi>lib. quest. de gratia Christi act.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; in concluſ.</hi> though he recite two opinions concerning this point, ſome holding, that he did not deſerue in the firſt inſtant of his conception, but anone after, and otherſome that he did deſerue in the very firſt moment therof (ſo wel do Papiſts agree in the materiall pointes of their religion) doth yet notwithſtanding approoue of the latter, as more reaſonable. Yea they croſſe the very truth and reaſon it ſelfe, bicauſe our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did many notable things beſides his ſufferings &amp; before his death, which alſo might as his death, iuſtly merit before God, both for himſelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, euen as his death did: for example his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and continuall praiers, his dayly and paineful preachings, his maruellous and infinit miracles, and many other good deedes: whereof alſo this is a verie good &amp; ſtrong reaſon, that if the good workes of men do after regeneration, <hi>ex condigno,</hi> as they ſay, merit both for themſelues &amp; others, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much more Chriſts good deedes muſt haue that power, in as much as in all innocencie, holineſſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, his workes did and doe farre exceede, not onely the good deedes of ſome good men, but all the good deedes of all the good men that haue bin, are, or ſhall be.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:6724:37"/>
            <p>And as for thoſe that maintaine, that in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and by the ſame hee merited as much at the firſt, as he did afterwardes by induring martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (of which minde is the maiſter of the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in the place aboue alleadged and ſome others) we affirme, that beſides that they agree not with thoſe that tie or binde his ſufferings to the time of his paſſion onelie, (of whome you haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they ſwarue alſo euen as the former, from truth of religion and humane reaſon; for firſt merit preſuppoſeth a good action or holie affection, that hath in it ſelfe power and abilitie to deſerue, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die paſt, for I ſuppoſe they will not holde, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either the one or the other, or both, there can be any deſert. But we feare not to affirme, that our Sauiour had not (and yet wee ſpeake without anie preiudice at all, to his bleſſed perſon or natures) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing in the very moment of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no, nor long time after, for anie thing wee can perceiue. If he had, let them ſhewe vs what it was, and then they ſhall heare our minds further in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>And as it is more abſurd by much to aſcribe his meriting, to the action of his conception, bicauſe that that was not his proper and peculiar deed, but the worke, partlie of the holie ghoſt, and partly of the virgine Marye, theſe two onely being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the conception, incarnation, and birth of our Sauiour, and not Chriſt himſelfe being the thing conceiued, incarnate, and borne, vnles they will ſay, either that one perſon of the godhead can purchaſe grace &amp; fauour for another, and ſo make God like vnto man, as they do by their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6724:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>doltiſh diſtinction before confuted, which is moſt horrible blaſphemie, bicauſe of the three ſeuerall and diſtinct perſons of the godhead, none is better, more great, or worthie than an other, or elſe, that earthlie mothers may merit for their ſonnes, and that in the act of generation and conception, which beſides that it is too groſſe and carnall, ſtandeth vp againſt the mercie of God, which muſt be in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects free, or elſe it is no mercie at all, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the ſcripture, and namely,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.4 10</note> Ezech. 18. where it is affirmed, that a good fathers holines or iuſtice ſhall no manner of way ſtand his vngracious childe in ſtead.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond we ſay, that they dare not aduouch that his whole perſon merited, bicauſe there is no ſuch thing warranted by the authoritie of Gods word, nor by the iudgement of right belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fathers. Nay their owne doctors are againſt that, as for example Peter Lombard in the place before alleadged, where he affirmeth out of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine vpon the ſecond chapter of Paules epiſtles to the Philippians, that all this was done, in the forme of a ſeruant: and Thomas of Aquine alſo, <hi>Quest. part.</hi> 2. <hi>quest. de gratia Christi, art.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; in concluſ.</hi> is of the very ſame minde, ſaying, that Chriſt merited not, but in reſpect that he was man, though in that reſpect he was more worthie than other men.</p>
            <p>If they will maintaine, that in his godhead hee merited, then one of theſe two abſurdities muſt of neceſſitie inſue vpon the dangerous aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either that the godhead hath merited more than it had, which is to make it ſubiect to imperfections and defects, and by conſequent God himſelfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6724:38"/>to become ſubiect to more and leſſe, and ſo to alteration and change, than the which nothing is or can be more blaſphemous, wee knowing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that God is moſt perfect, and remaineth alwayes like vnto himſelfe; or elſe that the godhead is paſſible (for the queſtion is here now of meriting by ſuffering) which is alſo as falſe and hereticall, as poſſibly can be, we hauing learned both by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the word, and the whole trueth of chriſtian religion, that the godhead is altogither impaſſible and can ſuffer nothing, bicauſe it hath bin alwaies of it ſelfe, is, and ſhall be for euer and euer, a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and eternall ſubſtance vtterly freed from al ſuch affections and paſſions.</p>
            <p>If they holde that in his other nature, to wit, his manhoode, he hath merited, as indeede it is their common aſſertion, then yet we ſay, that that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and erroneous likewiſe, bicauſe his manhoode is a creature, euen as wee our ſelues are (though he be freed from ſinne) and hard is it, yea it was yet neuer heard of, that creatures could indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue at the hands of the creator, who hath indued them with breath and being, and filled them of his owne free fauor, with the fulnes and riches of al his mercies. For what can the creator, by his infinit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, goodnes, wiſedome, and whatſoeuer elſe is excellent and high in him, purchaſe at the handes of his creatures, more than by wel-doing towardes them, to deſerue their loue and obedience againe towards him, and ſo they with an vnfained affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, imbrace, loue, and honour him? Dauid a man according to Gods owne hart, was content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.2.</note>

               <hi>VVhat shall I render to the Lorde for all his benefits to me,</hi> as if he ſhoulde ſay, I cannot tell what. Of a trueth I haue nothing that will anſwere the leaſt of them, much leſſe deſerue the beſt.</p>
            <p>And if they wil ſay, that he had the fulnes of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in himſelfe, wee anſweare that that will nothing helpe them. For though that be true, yet hee had it not as from his manhoode, though it were in his manhoode, but from the fulnes of the ſanctifieng ſpirit, and the excellencie of his eternall godhead, which did ſo plentifully, repleniſh his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with all manner of grace and goodnes,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.16.</note> that <hi>of his fulnes vve haue all receiued euen grace for grace,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding he hath neuer a whit the leſſe in himſelfe, no more than God by induing vs with immortall ſoules, or giuing vs wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſuch like, hath either ſpoiled himſelfe of, or diminiſhed his owne immortalitie, iuſtice, wiſdome, and other eſſentiall properties in him.</p>
            <p>Now then if Chriſt haue not merited, neither in his perſon, nor in his ſeuerall and diſtinct natures, as we haue already ſufficiently proued I hope: and we know not, neither beleeue any more in Chriſt, than his perſon and natures to work by, either they muſt of neceſſity let this curious dotage, of Chriſts meriting for himſelf paſſe &amp; vaniſh away like ſmoke in the aire, and ſo imbrace the contrarie truth togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with vs, or elſe ſhewe ſomething beſids in him, which hath performed this ſo high and excellent work, that they wil haue euery man, &amp; that not only for auoiding ſuſpition of hereſie, but vppon paine of condemnation of their ſouls vnfainedly to beleeue.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:6724:39"/>
            <p>In the third point, namely concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee merited to himſelfe, they are as hardely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and as much at their wits ende: yea and at as great iarres and contentions alſo amongſt them ſelues, touching the ſame, as they were in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſome affirming that he merited immortalitie to his bodie, and impaſſibilitie as they call it to his ſoule; and of this minde is the maiſter of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, in the place aboue quoated; otherſome that he merited life euerlaſting, and the glorie of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as our Rhemiſts vpon Rom. 8. and otherſome againe, that hee merited all and euerie one of theſe matters togither. For anſwere wherevnto, and to take no aduantage of this, that they can not agree nor reſolue, what it is certainely that hee merited to himſelfe (ſauing that by this wee may perceiue, that we haue little hope that they will conſent with vs in truth, that be at daggers drawing among them ſelues in falſhoode, bicauſe he verily will hardlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with any, that diffenteth from himſelfe) we tell them, that hee merited, neither any one of theſe things ſeuerally, nor all theſe things iointly, and that therefore whatſoeuer they holde herein, is but ſome ſwimming imaginations of their owne heads.</p>
            <p>For firſt, touching the immortalitie of his bodie, and the impaſſibilitie of his ſoule: if they ſay he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued theſe before his ſufferings, why had he not then his due deſerts giuen him, &amp; that in due time. For the thing deſeruing being once performed, the merit preſently groweth due, and if there be anie delay made, there is iniurie and iniuſtice offered, to the party deſeruing, by the party that ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, in as much as hee deteineth and vſeth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6724:39"/>that which is proper to another. And ſo by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Lorde is found both greately in debt to man, and iniuſt to all thoſe, whoſe wel-dooings hee rewardeth not, euen preſently after the worke is performed. But to vs, ouer and beſides the reaſon before alleadged, it ſeemeth impoſſible, that hee could deſerue either the one or the other of them, ſpecially ſith the articles of our religion teach vs to beleeue, that he was dead and buried, and the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſſureth vs, that hee ſuſtained moſt greeuous pangs and paſſions in his ſoule, ſpecially when he affirmed, that <hi>his ſoule vvas heauie euen vnto death:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.38.</note> and againe when hee cried out vppon the croſſe, in the anguiſh and bitterneſſe of his ſpirit, <hi>My God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 15.34.</note> 
               <hi>my God, vvhy hast thou forſaken me?</hi> What, was not God of power to performe that which Chriſt had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? Or was he not willing to ſatisfie and pay that which his onely ſonne had merited? Doe you not ſee that theſe abſurdities, errours, yea blaſphemies, muſt of neceſſitie follow vpon theſe lewſe and lewd concluſions.</p>
            <p>What, will you ſay he had theſe graces beſtowed vpon him after his death and reſurrection, by the power of his paſſion? I anſwere, that then you ſay as much, as if indeede you had ſaid nothing at all: firſt, bicauſe that the withholding of his deſerts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touched remaineth notwithſtanding ſtill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, and not taken away. Secondly, bicauſe that if he merited thoſe things, by his conception (as the maſter holdeth) it is vnſeaſonable to aſcribe theſe merits or things deſerued to an other matter. Thirdly, bicauſe that in that meriting, what had Chriſt, that we haue not, I meane the faithfull? For
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6724:40"/>after naturall death they haue as in reſpect of their ſoules,<note place="margin">Reuel. 7.17.</note>

               <note place="margin">Philip. 3.21.</note> 
               <hi>vvhereby Christ is able euen to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things vnto himſelfe;</hi> be raiſed againe, and be made mortall and glorious, as the ſcripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacheth in many places, and namely, 1. Cor. 15. Wherevpon alſo it will follow directly, that as men in their doctrine may merit, ſo they may merite as muche to themſelues as Chriſt didde for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But of a truth, the mortalitie of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtandeth not, as they ſuppoſe, vppon Chriſts meriting of it, but vpon the trueth and certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the promiſes paſſed long before hee was clad with our fleſh.<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.10.</note> The prophet ſaying, <hi>Thou vvilt not leaue my ſoule in the graue, neither vvilt thou ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> Which place the apoſtle Peter doth notably expound in the Acts, in plaine and euident termes,<note place="margin">Acts 2.24.</note> telling vs, that <hi>it vvas impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that hee shoulde be held dovvne of the ſorrovves of death:</hi> this impoſſibilitie ariſing, not from the ſtrength of his merits, but from the power of God, raiſing him vp mightily againe from the dead. And the like may be ſaide for the impaſſibilitie of his ſoule.</p>
            <p>As for they that affirme, that our Sauiour meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heauen and eternall glorie by his ſufferings, we feare not to tell them, and that to their faces, that (either in the pride or ignorance of their hearts) they ſpeake they wot not what, and in the lightnes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6724:40"/>of their braine, and idleneſſe of their head, they babble out things directly contrary to the worde, and to the iudgement alſo of ſome of the beſt of their ſides.

               <note place="margin">Iohn 14.6.</note> 
               <hi>and the trueth</hi>) a liar. Dooth not Melchios Canus one of the doubtieſt diuines, being conuicted with the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this truth confeſſe the ſame? Will they go againſt the plaine wordes of Chriſt? And will they thwarte the iudgement of their beſt friendes? It is fearefull, but ſpeciallie in matters of falſhoode and vntrueth, to doe either the one or the other: for to croſſe their acquaintance, is to weaken and diſcredite their owne cauſe and dealing: and to oppoſe themſelues againſt Chriſt, is to pull iudgement and condemnation vppon themſelues, bicauſe <hi>he is the stone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21.44.</note> 
               <hi>vvhich vvhoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shall fall on shall be broken, and on vvhomſoeuer it shall fall, it shall grinde him to povvder.</hi> But both theſe miſchiefes and inconueniences, they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie fall into, that will vphold and defend ſuch falſhoodes and vncertainties.</p>
            <p>And if their errors had ſtaied here and gone no further, than to magnifie Chriſt and his merites (though indeede they haue done it beyond al truth and reaſon) it had bin leſſe euill for themſelues, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6724:41"/>more profitable for vs, who might by that meanes haue ſpared a great deale both of labour and time, that we muſt of neceſſitie now beſtowe, leaſt their poiſon ſhoulde infect the ſoules of men. But as one iniquitie is readie to bring foorth another, ſo they haue proceeded to tell vs, that men alſo by their ſufferings may merit eternall life. But who ſeeth not how infinitly abſurd in reaſon this is, to argue from Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.17. 2. Cor. 5.19.</note> free from ſin, and the perſon <hi>in vvhom alone God vvas vvell pleaſed, and reconciled the vvorld vnto himſelfe,</hi> and had in him full &amp; abſolute iuſtice, yea ſuch abundance of it, that hee hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, holineſſe, innocencie, and righteouſneſſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all beleeuers, to men, tainted with all manner of iniquitie, who neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pleaſe god for themſelues, nor others; who alſo when they haue doone all that can be doone in this life, are yet notwithſtanding clogged with defects and wants, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they cannot, not onely procure vnto themſelues any good things, but purchaſe eternall confuſion and euerlaſting death, as hath bin alreadie plainlie enough and ſufficiently proued.</p>
            <p>And as abſurd and vnreaſonable certainly is that their marginall note, wherein they affirme, that all ſuffrings in this life is nothing in compariſon of the heauenly glory, and yet that it is meritorious and worthie of the ſame. For doe not all men, euen by the very light of reaſon ſee and know, that there is, and muſt of neceſſitie be, a certaine analogie and proportion betweene the thing deſeruing, and the thing deſerued, or elſe the party deſeruing cannot claime as of dutie, but of beneuolence, vnles they will extort and wring foorth more than they haue
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6724:41"/>merited. Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing deſerue any thing, or a matter of ſmall induſtry &amp; labor merit a kingdom or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crowne? Of a trueth no: much leſſe then can that which they themſelues call nothing (and woulde to God they thought it nothing indeede, then would they let the cauſe and queſtion about nothing fall to the ground) deſerue ſo excellent a thing, as the incorruptible crowne, and the heauenly kingdome of eternall life is. No, that (as the apoſtle teacheth vs) <hi>is the free gift of God.</hi> And if it be free,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> it muſt be in all parts, and in all reſpects free, or elſe not at all, as on the other ſide, merits muſt be altogither merits, or elſe no merits at all, bicauſe if there be the leaſt part of the thing deſerued, exceeding our deſerts, then are they ſo daſhed and defaced that they cannot in any vpright iudgement ſtand vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God or man to merit any thing. For euen as the Apoſtle reaſoneth, and that rightlie of workes and grace, affirming, that <hi>if Gods election be of grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note> 
               <hi>it is no more of vvorkes, or elſe vvere grace no more grace: or if it be of vvorkes, it is no more of grace, or elſe vvere vvorkes no more vvorkes:</hi> ſo may we ſafely affirme of Gods goodnes, and mans merits, namely, that if eternall life in the whole, and euery part of it, be a free gift, grace, and goodneſſe of God beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs in Chriſt, then it is not of deſert or merite, for then Gods grace, gift, and goodnes, ſhall be no more grace, gift, and goodnes; and if it be of merit and deſert, then it can not be of grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, bicauſe then merit and deſert can be no more merit and deſert.</p>
            <p>Sure I am of this, and I hope euery good man, that is acquainted with the trueth of the worde, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6724:42"/>hath particular experience of his owne corruption, will with me confeſſe this to be true, that there is no more contrarietie in the matter and queſtion of free iuſtification before God in Chriſt, betweene the grace of God and the workes of the lawe, than there is betwixt Gods free goodnes, in the matter of eternall life, and the ſuppoſed merits that man muſt bring with him to the obtaining thereof. And therefore if the argument be of force in the one, it muſt alſo of neceſſitie conclude, and that rightlie in the other.</p>
            <p>As for that which they obiect touching the Greek phraſe, it wil no whit at al vphold their weake cauſe and rotten building, it being indeede a childiſh lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomachie or contention about wordes; and that not onely beſides the Apoſtles purpoſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but alſo contrarie to their own note, the ſpeech it ſelfe, being not a comparatiue ſpeech, as they fondly imagine, but a plaine and flat deniall, yea a deniall after a ſort, as a man woulde ſay, by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, rather than by compariſon; as if he ſhould ſay, they are in no caſe machable or comparable, this alſo being the Apoſtles ſpeciall purpoſe, not to reaſon of the value or price of ſuch afflictions, as the faithfull indure or ſuffer for Chriſts ſake in this life, but to ſhew rather, that whether wee reſpect the qualitie or quantitie of them (as a man woulde ſay) and compare the ſame with eternall life and ſaluation, we may eaſily yet gather therevpon, that we ſhal be infinitly more bleſſed with Chriſt, when we ſhal in the kingdome of heauen, be gathered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and vnited with him, as our true and onely head, than euer we were miſerable, while wee liued
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6724:42"/>here vppon the face of the earth. And the truth of this may appeare not onelie by the plaine wordes, and very drift and purpoſe of the apoſtle as before, but alſo by his maner of ſpeech, hee ſpeaking not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paratiuely, ſpecially in extolling of our ſufferings (which he greatly debaſeth, by affirming them no maner of way worthy of eternall glorie) but rather in magnifieng of euerlaſting liſe. Yea the worde it ſelfe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, being vſed in his right and proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification (which as the grammarians doe wel wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is affirmed of thoſe things, that being weighed one with another, are found to be of equall poiſe or weight) with a negatiue particle put before it, to aboliſh the credit that wee woulde carry with our ſelues and before others, in &amp; about our ſufferings and to extoll the wonderful excellencie of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie kingdome, can not chooſe but euince and gaine this point at their handes.</p>
            <p>Touching other allegations, as namely, that out of Prouerbes 3. and 2. Corinthians 4. (for we mind not to ſtand vppon places alleadged out of the bookes called Apocrypha, as Eccleſiaſticus, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, and ſuch like) in as much as they are but produced onely for the phraſe, and yet prooue not the matter, for which they are brought forth, we ſhall (God willing) anſwere the ſame in ſome more conuenient place, ſpecially ſith we haue bene long already in this confutation, this being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this preſent, to let the worlde vnderſtand, that they are brought foorth very impertinently, and onelie to no purpoſe, but contrarie to truth alſo.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:6724:43"/>
            <p>There remaineth only one reaſon, that ſeemeth to haue ſome pith in it, to wit, that wee may as well affirme, that the workes of ſin demerit not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that the ſufferings of Gods ſaints, deſerue not eternall ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) but this indeed as the former, hath neither bones, nor marrowe, nor ſinnows, nor fleſh, nor any thing elſe, that may giue it force or ſtrength. For howſoeuer arguments taken from contraries, may be ſtrong in humane reaſon (and yet there they be not ſo vniuerſall, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be iuſtly obiected againſt the ſame) yet in matters of religion, faith, and the ſeruice of God, they haue not any ſuch ſure footing, as theſe men fantaſie. That righteouſnes and ſinne be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, as alſo ſaluation and damnation, no man in his right wits I thinke will deny, but that the one ſhould ariſe from man, as wel as the other, no man vnleſſe he be ſtarke madde and inſenſible, yea pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhly hereticall,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.16.</note> will euer affirme. <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thornes,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.13.</note> not onely naturall (for that all muſt taſte of,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.27.</note> 
               <hi>God hauing appointed that all men shall once die, and after that commeth the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) but eternall proper and peculiar to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned onely; and conſequently ſheweth vs, that <hi>eternall life</hi> (which hee oppoſeth againſt eternall death and damnation) <hi>is the gift of God, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ our Lord,</hi> ſetting there-againſt mans ſinne and corruption, not mans imagined righteouſnes, as they would haue it, but Gods great gift &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes beſtowed vpon vs, in, and for Chriſt Ieſus ſake onely, wythout which of a trueth, not onely no one man could euer be ſaued, but all fleſh muſt of neceſſitie periſh.</p>
            <p>In logike there is a rule, which alſo they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6724:44"/>approoue of, namely, that as we haue great ſcarcitie of true differences for many things, ſo the reaſon of that want is not in the naturall thinges themſelues (for no doubt but euerie ſeuerall kinde hath his right difference) but in that lacke of light, iudgement, and experience, which lieth lurking in euery one of our ſelues. The like wee can not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend here, both bicauſe God is more perfect than nature, as who is Lord thereof, and alſo bicauſe he hath inlarged himſelfe ſo, that we may plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and ſee the truth of this point. And if naturall things may by their ſeuerall differences be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerued, one of them from an other, how much more truly &amp; ſurely may we diſtinguiſh God from men, and the workes of his holineſſe and grace, from the deeds of our curſed corruption? Why do we not deale herein as we do in worldly affaires? If wee will rightly diſcerne of them, wee will oppoſe things that be contrary indeed one of them againſt another, as blacke againſt white, war againſt peace, &amp;c. Bicauſe wee reſt perſuaded, that ſo they may be beſt diſcerned, no man in this caſe dealing ſo fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to compare yellow and blacke togither, or to reſemble a colour, with a thing that is not in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, which our aduerſaries doe, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing mans ſuppoſed righteouſnes (which indeede is not at all, and therefore their dealings more abſurd in that behalfe) againſt mans ſinne, the euidence whereof is ſo notorions, that it is moſt liuely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out vnto vs, by the light of the worde, by the ſtinging teſtimony of our owne hearts, and by that great floud of all manner of wickedneſſe, which as heeretofore, ſo preſently ouerfloweth all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6724:44"/>if euer men manifeſted ignora unce in diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or elſe faulted foulie, in matter of oppoſing contraries one of them to an other, our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this behalfe be moſt ſhamefully ouertaken, who though they do ſet life againſt death, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation againſt damnation, haue not yet in the working and performance of theſe things, learned to ſet God againſt man, and his grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, againſt mans peruerſeneſſe and euill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo theſe inconueniences fall out, not onelie that men are puffed vppe in pride aboue meaſure, and that in their owne eies, before GOD and their brethren, but the infinite riches of GODS grace and goodneſſe alſo, is as much (as they may) vtterlie obſcured and darkened, which doth not in anie, nor in all thinges whatſoeuer, more plentifully and plainely ſhewe foorth it ſelfe, than in the forgiueneſſe of the ſins of his ſeruants, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the death and obedience of his ſonne Chriſt, &amp; the bringing of them to euerlaſting life and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, thorowe his powerfull reſurrection, and glorious aſcenſion, notwithſtanding that by the meanes of their iniquities, they haue deſerued the contrarie, to wit, euerlaſting condemnation both of bodie and ſoule, with the diuell and his angelles, in that lake of fire &amp; brimſtone that burneth for euer.</p>
            <p>One thing more there is in their notes vppon this place, which I cannot wel let paſſe, bicauſe it is a branch of their corrupted doctrine, &amp; ſauoreth as much of error and hereſie as the former points, to wit, that they affirme, that the value of Chriſts acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, riſeth out of the length or greatneſſe of them in themſelues, but of the worthines of the perſon.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6724:45"/>What if wee yeelde to this, as to a trueth? What ſhall you gaine thereby? or what will you inferre therevpon? Forſooth, that ſo the value of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions riſeth of the grace of our adoption. But wee tell you it is a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> as they ſay in ſchooles. Wil you always <hi>plovve vvith an oxe and an aſſe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 22 10 11</note> And wil you continually <hi>vveare a garment of linſey vvolſey?</hi> And will you neuer learne for all that hath beene ſaid, to compare and reſemble, either quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things, or right equall and like things togither? Why do you not infer (for ſo you ſhold haue done, if you would haue dealt plainely) that the price of our works riſeth from the worthines of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo? But this you knew was blaſphemous, and contrarie to the written word of God, which in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places reiecteth both vs, &amp; our good deeds, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are done, with an opinion or mind to merit, and that before God, as hath beene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy plainely prooued, and therefore you wil ſmooth it ouer with the grace of adoption. To which we tell you in fewe wordes, that we our ſelues do in truth and ſinceritie attribute more to the grace of Gods adoption, than you that babble ſo much of it, and vnder ſuch colours go about to deceiue the hearts of the ſimple. And yet notwithſtanding all this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards you bluſh not to ſaye, that good workes which be meritorious proceede from the childe of God.</p>
            <p>But deale plainely with vs and the worlde we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, and tel vs, but yet in no darke ſpeeches, whether the merite of mans workes proceede from the grace of adoption onely, yea or no? Or elſe whether the merit of them floweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men alone,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6724:45"/>as they are Gods adopted children? Or elſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God and man togither, as working cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of merit? For our owne parts wee feare not to affirme, that whatſoeuer you will put downe in this caſe, is, and muſt be accounted in the iudgement of truth meerely abſurde and erronious. For to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it vnto the grace of adoption by it ſelfe, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from man and his merits, that you dare not, bicauſe it is flatly oppoſite to the whole doctrine of poperie, and to your owne aſſertions in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces agreeable therewith: Beſides the grace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, is a free gift of God, and not a merit; for of whome (I pray you) ſhould God deſerue it for our ſakes? And to caſt it vpon men alone, without the grace and fauour of God, is not onelie preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as in regarde of man,<note place="margin">Iohn 25.5.</note> 
               <hi>vvho vvithout him can do nothing;</hi> and yet againſt him wil haue heauen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or no, if that be once yeelded vnto, but is bla phemous to God, whoſe grace and goodnes muſt needs be vtterlie euacuated, if that aſſertion be eſtabliſhed. And if you will ſay it proceedeth from both togither, that alſo is as vnreaſonable and falſe, bicauſe one and the ſelfe-ſame ſtreame alone, as for example your matter of merits here, which is but one thing, can not proceede from two ſeuerall heads, ſpecially ſo oppoſite one of them to another, as god &amp; man are, yea and it hath bin hardly heard of, that euen in naturall things, there ſhould be two principall efficient cauſes, concurring to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of one and the ſelfe ſame ſubiect.</p>
            <p>Of a truth wee can not but tell you in all plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſimplicitie, that if you will holde, that the merit of mans workes commeth from man, as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6724:46"/>of, and from himſelfe alone, or as coupled with an other, that then the whole worde written, the certaintie of religion yeelded to in all ages, and teſtimonie of trueth in former time declared, wil crie out againſt you, blaſphemie, and intollerable preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yea al the world that is of ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot but condemne you, for matching vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall thinges togither, yea for mingling moſt cleane, and moſt filthie thinges one of them wyth another. For though wee might grant, that the grace of adoption, as it proceedeth from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo a perfect worke (as nothing comming from him can be vnperfect) might as in reſpect of it ſelfe (if it were not defiled with our corruptions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections) merit ſomething before God, yet there is no cauſe at all why we ſhoulde yeelde to it, when our workes be ioined therewith, conſidering how much we taint and deface euen the beſt graces of God in vs, or beſtowed vppon vs.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point of confutation (wherein we confeſſe we haue bin very long, but our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries importunitie and tediouſnes hath drawen vs thereto) with a notable teſtimonie or two of ſome one of the docto is of the church in ſtead of manie, (though I doe not greatly delight I confeſſe, in the allegation of them, bicauſe the trueth of the worde without them is ſtrong enough, as which hath not his credite and authoritie from men, but from the Lorde himſelfe) that ſo it may appeere how much they haue, both in ſenſe and doctrine, peruerted this place, and ſwarued from the godlie iudgement of former times.

That worde <hi>(shal be)</hi> inſtructeth all of vs, with faith and patience to expect the manifeſtation thereof, not doubting, but ſtedfaſtly beleeuing, that though there be ſome delay of the accompliſhment of this, yea and though our preſent afflictions be neuer ſo many, great, and greeuous, that yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a time will come, when they ſhall be vtterly remooued, and taken away from vs, and we our ſelues put into actuall and reall poſſeſſion, of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ioyes promiſed, the faithfull performaunce whereof, we did and yet do, in ſome meaſure of a ſound hope looke after.</p>
            <p>Neither doubt I, but euen in this behalfe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, touching the delay of the things promiſed, there do and wil ariſe by meanes of their natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many temptations in the mindes of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thoſe alſo increaſed, not onely by Satans malice, who laboureth to make vs beleeue, that either GOD can not or will not be as good as his word, but foſtred and fed, by texts of ſcripture alſo not wel vnderſtoode or rightly applied, as when the holy ghoſt ſhal ſay,<note place="margin">Prou. 13.12.</note>

In worldly matters, when men deale with men, yet are they not diſmaied with delayes, but rather raiſe vp their hope herein, that the deferring of the things promiſed, is not a taking away of the ſame, or elſe perſuade themſelues, that the length of time ſhall be recompenced, either with the excellencie &amp; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the things themſelues, or with ſom one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or other an other waie. How much more ſhould we be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, not only in this that we deal not with man, who is euen as the wind and weather wauering &amp; vncertaine, but with God, who alwayes continueth like vnto himſelfe, and haue from him the aſſured promiſes, as of al benefits generally, ſo of ſuch bleſſings in the life to come particularly, as with the leaſt wherof, al the delights and pleaſures of this worlde whatſoeuer, no though they were al laid togither, &amp; beſtowed vpon one man, were anie maner of way matchable, ſpecially, ſith that GOD knowing our harts and ſtate, better than we do our ſelues, doth therfore many times put off the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce of ſuch excellent things, that ſo hee might make vs the more reuerently to eſteeme of them, when we receiue them, and the more earneſtly to deſire them, when we want them, that are ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable &amp; profitable for euerie one of vs.</p>

Whereof that we might be the better perſuaded, yea euen then when he letteth vs for a little while, want our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer comforts, hee doth yet vouchſafe vs innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable tokens and pledges of his moſt conſtant loue, and that not onelie in bodily benefits, as health, wealth, libertie, &amp;c. but, as was ſaid before, in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bleſſings alſo, as in his worde, ſacraments, praier, and a great number ſuche like effectuall meanes, to bring vs in good time, to that quiet hauen of heauen and eternall reſt, that wee in the midſt of the manifolde toſſings and turmoils of this wretched life, haue often and earneſtlie wiſhed for.</p>

               <hi>(Bicauſe the creature)</hi>
            </q>
            <p>In this, and the verſe following, the Apoſtle ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth two cauſes, why the creatures wait, for the time of the reuealing of the ſonnes of God. That which is contained in this verſ, reſpecteth the pains and troubles that they are ſubiect to, heere in this worlde. That which is comprehended in the other verſe, toucheth the hope that they haue, of freedom from this fearefull bondage, they paciently ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the one, and earneſtly looking for the other, bicauſe that vntill then, they are, and muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, by Gods ordinance, and the ende of their creation alſo, be ſubiect to death and corruption; which thing being once performed &amp; finiſhed, they ſhall be no more ſubiect to that wretched and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate, but vtterly &amp; altogither freed from the ſame. The word creature heere, is taken in the ſame ſenſe that it was before, ver. 19. of this chapter, whereof alſo, there is great reaſon, ſith the Apoſtle continueth his ſpeech of the ſelfe-ſame matter.</p>
            <p>He addeth <hi>(is ſubiect to vanitie)</hi> that is, not onely vnto man <hi>vvho is vanitie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm. 62.9.</note> 
               <hi>yea lighter than vanitie it ſelfe, laid vpon the ballance vvith it</hi> (as the prophet in plaine termes affirmeth) and his vaine delights, but to vaniſhing, flitting, weake, and vnſound eſtate. Of both which points we need no great or long proof, bicauſe our owne daily and continuall experience, doth againe &amp; againe, ſufficiently declare the ſame vnto vs. For what do the murrens, ſickneſſes, and infinite diſeaſes, and at the laſt death alſo, attending vpon the creatures preach elſe vnto vs? And what
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6724:56"/>can we ſee elſe in the exceſſiue abuſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, throughout the whole courſe of mens liues, ſome in apparell abuſing them to pride and newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanglednes, otherſome in eating and drinking, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to luſt, wantonnes, glutonie, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, otherſome by a hoarding of them vp, and hauing no vſe of them, ſubiecting them to moaths, wormes, ruſt, and rottennes, depriuing, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo others, and ſpecially the church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the free &amp; chriſtian vſe of them, no man almoſt among ten thouſand ſtriuing, or caring, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly and in ſanctification to vſe them. <hi>(Not of it ovvne vvill.)</hi> The reaſon is, bicauſe if the creature could chooſe, it would not be ſubiect to that poor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. By which we may ſee, that he meaneth then, that it is vnwillingly in reſpect of it ſelf, brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this condition, and yet notwithſtanding by the meanes of mans ſin ſubdued to this thraldome and ſlauery. And ſeing we know that ſuch creaturs haue no ſens or wit, thogh for our rudenes ſake ſuch thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are aſcribed to them, let vs therfore vnderſtand that <hi>(vvil)</hi> in this place, muſt be taken for ſom natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination in the creatures, againſt which they are ſubiect, as before, &amp; not otherwiſe. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs yeelde to this, bicauſe we ſee by the light of humane reſon, that eueri thing doth by a natural inſtinct aime at the preſeruation of it ſelfe, what it can: &amp; if it can not effect it, it is not for want of care or loue in themſelues, for themſelues, but by reaſon of ſom more ſtrong working cauſe, either inward or outward, to which thei are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to giue place.</p>

Nay what ſpeake I of ſuch great things? Why do we not ſhunne, if we could, the ſtinging of bees and waſpes, the bitings of gnats, flies, and ſundrie ſuch like. We ſee then, that this muſt needes be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of God alone, bicauſe it is as a man woulde ſay, a certain deſcription of him: For in whoſe hand and power is it elſe, to cauſe the creatures to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake at his preſence, and to walke in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto his good pleaſure, but in the Lords alone.</p>

            <p>To wit, of reſtitution, to that excellent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which they had by creation, and of deliuerie from that miſerable and ſlauiſh eſtate, wherin they preſently are, and not vnder hope, either of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity or vſe, as ſome dote and dreame; of both which points, and ſome others alſo, wee will ſpeake hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God willing, but yet no otherwiſe by gods grace, then as we haue learned out of gods worde. In the meane while let vs marke, that in theſe wordes, the Apoſtle mindeth to giue vs to vnderſtand, that God neuer purpoſed, for mans ſinne, to ſubiect his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to a continuall courſe, or ſuch a puniſhment, as ſhould neuer be done away, but hath giuen them ſome hope, that they ſhall bee freed from the ſame.

And the woorde of deliuering that the Apoſtle vſeth, would be marked, as by which he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the free eſtate, that they ſhalbe brought vnto, which alſo the greek word it ſelf doth very elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly import, containing in it ſelfe, &amp; expreſſing in the vſe of it this much, that they ſhalbe deliuered from the wretched eſtate of bond-ſlaues or bond-men, into the glorious and comfortable condition

Beſides, wee all knowe and beleeue, that without faith there is, as no purifieng of hearts, ſo no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into heauen: and that gift of beleefe vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, ſhall neuer attaine vnto: neither yet all men, bicauſe as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Faith is not of all men,</hi>

            <p>If any would ſay, that this might ſerue mightilie for the manifeſtation of Gods mercie, I anſwe are, firſt, that God knoweth beſt, when, where, and vpon whom alſo to diſcloſe his goodnes without light or inſtruction from vs: next, that they ſhoulde more plainely appeare, in ſauing reaſonable creatures, euen the very reprobate and wicked, than in ſauing theſe dumbe and inſenſible things. And if Gods mercie were to be reuealed that way, why not in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6724:59"/>that that was furtheſt from ſaluation, I meane the diuell and damned ſpirits, who both by reaſon of their ſinne, and in that they are paſt hope of a better condition, are further ſundred from eternall life, than the ſenſleſſe and brutiſh creatures: that I may ſay nothing of the excellencie of their nature, as it was by creation, being farre more fit in that reſpect, for eternall life, than the carnall and groſe nature and conſtitution of beaſts and other things. But that is impoſſible, both as in regarde of God, who hath reuealed the contrarie in his worde, and alſo as in reſpect of vs, to whome we knowe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that all things are impoſſible, that God hath declared by his truth ſhall not be done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo the other but a fond conceit of mens idle heads. This rather as I take it, he meaneth, that in their kind and manner, they ſhalbe made pertakers of a far better eſtate, then they had, while the world indured, becauſe that God ſhall fullie and wholye reſtore the world, being fallen into corruption, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the tranſgreſſion and ſinne of mankinde, which yet as ſeemeth to me maie more plainely appeare, in that amplifieng by the contraries, hee oppoſeth ſubſequent libertie, againſt former bondage, which that hee might the more inlarge, hee calleth it not ſimplie freedome or libertie, but libertie of glorie, as it is in the greeke text, meaning thereby accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the phraſe and proprietie of the Hebrue toong, glorious libertie or liberty that bringeth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with it, vnder which terme of glorie he compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, the excellent eſtate, that they ſhalbe in, after their deliuery fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their former baſenes &amp; ſeruitude.</p>

The neglect whereof hath in time paſt, and at this preſent alſo, becauſe men haue not bene ſoberlie minded, caſt them into beaſtlie errors, and made men fowlie to ouerſhoote themſelues, as in manie
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6724:62"/>vncertaine and dangerous points, ſo principallie in two reſpectes: firſt that they dare affirme, that after this great reſtitution, the creatures ſhalbe durable, and remaine as it were immortall. The other is, that at that time alſo there ſhalbe vſe of them; Neither were the olde heretickes, I meane <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and the <hi>Chiliastae</hi> ouertaken onelie, which theſe beaſtlie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and conceits, but euen ſome of the fathers of greateſt antiquity, yea &amp; other of late daies, though otherwiſe in manie pointes, of verie ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, haue inclined to much that way, though not in iumping altogither with them. Concerning which points, in truth I could ſay nothing, had they with the length of time, and continuance of ages, worne awaie, and periſhed to rottenneſſe, as one that thinketh it better not to ſtire ſuch filthe, leaſt the ſtincke of it, might not onelye breede trouble, but infect and defile manie alſo, ſauing that euen in this laſt age of the worlde; Sathan hath ſtirred vp manie lewd inſtruments, afreſhe, to ſet abroach theſe corruptions, and amongſt the reſt one R. E. I ſpare to put downe his name wholie as yet, for it maye bee, that God at ſome one time or other, maye pull him out of that great puddle of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into which, thorow manie errors, if not hereſies, he is deepely ſuncke, and bring him againe into the waie of trueth and ſaluation, from which hee hath ſtraied. But leauing the perſons, let vs come to the pointes.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt to witte, that the creatures after their reſtitution and reuocation, at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reſurrection, ſhall continue and remayne for euer, mee thincketh this reaſon ſhould carrie
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6724:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſome force and waight with it, againſte the ſame: namelie, that for as much as all men, ſome few on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye excepted, doe confidenthe and groundedlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that after the generall reſurrection, there ſhalbe no vſe of the creatures, that therefore alſo there ſhould bee no eternall durableneſſe or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce of them; For if in the firſt creation when GOD in his almightie and euerlaſting knowledge, fore-ſawe that confuſion thorowe ſinne, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the worlde, hee did yet notwithſtanding create nothing, but verie good, and that to excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vſe and purpoſe it ſhould ſeeme, not onelye probable, but certaine, that ſith nowe as then hee doth in his eternall wiſedome fore-ſee, that ſingular perfection, that by his moſt mightie power in their reſtitution, they ſhalbe reſtored to, that either they muſt of neceſſitie bee ſubiected to ſome holye and neceſſarie vſes, or elſe that their immortalitie, ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be beſtowed vpon them in vaine: which were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe God, ether of leſſe care, or leſſe power, or both, in this notable worke of the reſtauration of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, he drawing them as it were out of that, into which they haue bene diſſolued, than he had at the firſt creation of them, when hee made them all of nothing, as chriſtian religion and the woorde doe plainlie propound vnto vs. But if againſt this, they will obiect, that gods glorye ſhall thereby bee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullye manifeſted, I anſwere, that his power and glory, ſhal be greatly prouided for and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declared in that great, generall, yea and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine reſtauration of them, though they indure but a ſmale whyle, or no whitte all, I call it greate and generall, beecauſe that in the ende
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6724:63"/>of the world it ſhalbe as great and vniuerſall a work, as the worke of creation at the beginning (if not more large) in as much as not onelye the ſeuerall ſortes and kindes of thinges created, but all that haue bene, are, or ſhalbe vnto the end, ſhall then ſtand foorth in a moſt excellent eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen as glorious and good, as they were at the firſt before ſinne entred, in as much as at that daie, euen ſinne it ſelfe ſhall ceaſe, and be as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And I name the ſame ſodaine alſo, becauſe as the Lordes comming and the reſurrection of the dead, ſhall be in a moment and pinch of time, or in the turning of a hand, as you would ſaye, <hi>or the tvvinckling of an eie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> as the ſcripture ſpeaketh: ſo ſhal alſo this great worke of the reſtitutition, the Lorde not taking manie daies, as at the beginning of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the performaunce of this noble deede, but doing it quickly, and vppon the ſodaine, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſtation of his almightie power &amp; glory.</p>
            <p>But becauſe wee are fallen into ſpeache of gods glorie, and the glorifieng of his name: I would faine know this of them, that now ſo much vrge it, to wit, who they are, that the creatures reſtored ſhal ſtirre vp, to glorifie GOD in the ſight and beholding of them. Of god himſelf, they dare not affirme it, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe as in reſpect of his owne moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent eſſence and beeing, he hath no neede by ſuche meanes to bee prouoked, to ſeeke his owne glory, which alſo hath from all eternitie bene, is, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall bee ſo greate, that not they alone, but not all the creatures, either heauenlye or earthlie, ſhalbe able to adde therto, ſo much as a ſhadow or moſt ſmall ſparke. If they wil maintaine it of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6724:63"/>either elect or reprobate, that is as vnſounde alſo, for as for the elect Angels, they in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of their nature, promooting alreadie Gods glorie, and that in all perfection, though not of it, yet of them ſelues, can not then haue that deſire anie whit encreaſed in them, the perfection wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they haue alreadie thorowe Gods goodneſſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto, and vnto perfection wee knowe that nothing can bee added; Beſides that beeing ſimply and onelye of ſpirituall natures, it maye bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion, whether that by ſuch outwarde thinges, they may be furthered in ſuch holy duties; And as for the reprobated Angelles, and damned ſpirites, becauſe they are continuallie carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, thorowe the corruption of their nature, as with malice towardes man, whoſe ſaluation they would hinder, to the vttermoſt, ſo with enuie and diſdaine towardes GOD, the encreaſe of whoſe glorie is an addition to their torments, they cannot (though there might bee ſome ſuche force in the creatures reſtored, which yet is not prooued) or at the leaſt wiſe they will not bee prouoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to giue glorie to GOD, becauſe that the more that he is glorified, the more greeuouſly &amp; greatly, are they them ſelues tormented, that I maye ſaye nothing of that impoſſibilitie that is in them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this dutie, aſwel by reaſon of the deprauation of their nature, as that irreuocable and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſentence of condemnation for euer, that the LORD the moſt iuſt iudge hath alreadie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and after a ſort pronounced vpon them all: There reſteth none nowe but men, which are of two ſortes, good and bad, damned, and ſaued,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6724:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>concerning either of which to affirme it, is abſurde and vnreaſonable as the former. For as for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, is there anie likelihoode, that they that in this life,<note place="margin">Pſalme 17.</note> 
               <hi>had their bellies filled vvith the hidden treaſures of God,</hi> and inioyed both ſea and land, and had infinit occaſions giuen them to glorifie his name, in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral allowance and continual vſe of his creatures, and yet for all this were blind to ſee gods glory, and dumbe or tongue-tyed, to ſpeake vnto his praiſe, ſhall in the life to come, where they ſhall not onely haue no vſe of thoſe bleſſinges, but a full meaſure of condemnation lying vpon them, as for all their ſinnes generallie, ſo particularlie for the abuſe of ſo manie excellent graces, that they ſhoulde then and there glorifie his name? Naie wee feare not to affirme on the other ſide, that they ſhalbe ſo farre off, from ſeeing or confeſſing gods glory in them at that time, that beeing in the ſtate of eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, far ſeperated alſo from the place, where the creatures reſtored ſhalbe, that they ſhall haue their hearts, bodies, ſoules, and all continuallie ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, with the feeling of their owne torments, and their mouthes alwaies repleniſhed, partlye with all manner of lamentation and mourning, by reaſon of the moſt miſerable and euerlaſting paines they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and partlie with all kinde of blaſphemie, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and contempt of Gods eternall Maieſtie and themſelues. And as for the faithfull, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, beeing then in the kingdome of heauen, (a place marueilouſlie muche diſtant, from that place that the reſtored creatures ſhalbe in) and beeing filled alſo with the fulneſſe of the ioyes of GOD, they ſhall bee ſo farre off from fixing their eies, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6724:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>anie of the creatures, from whome they ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee ſundered further by many degrees, then mans eyes can well deſcrie, in as muche as the ſpace betweene heauen which they ſhall poſſeſſe, and the earth, that the reſtored creatures ſhall occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, is exceedingly great, that they ſhall not haue neyther ſight nor ſenſes mooued, muche leſſe buſied in beholding ſuche things, but rather ſhall haue all the thoughtes of their heartes, all the woordes of their mouthes, and all the actions and partes of their bodies, and affections and powers of their ſoules continuallie taken vppe and occupied, in the contemplation of GOD, the fountayne of all goodneſſe, <hi>alvvayes prayſing of hym alſo, that ſitteth vppon the throvvne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reue. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>and in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of him for euermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe then if that neither GOD, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles, nor damned ſpyrites, nor elected men, nor the wicked condemned, ſhall haue vſe of the creatures, this waye foorth, to ſtirre them vppe to glorifie GOD, and Gods glorie can not bee, but as in reſpecte either of all theſe, or ſome one of theſe, it muſt directlie followe, in my mind, that this is but a dotage or dreame, that theſe men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, concerning the continuaunce of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, after the reſtitution, ſpecially as they will haue it, for the manifeſtation and inlarging of the glorie of God.</p>
            <p>That was indeede wee muſt acknowledge it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.1.</note> the ende wherefore God created them at the firſt, and the Lorde himſelfe had appointed them, to ſerue vnto that vſe in this life, and ſo long as the worlde laſteth, that thereby the very wicked
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6724:65"/>might be <hi>vvithout excuſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> and the godly prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked more and more to praiſe him; but for as much as this naturall life ſhall ceaſe,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>And the vvorlde vvith all that is therein shall be purged and conſumed by fire,</hi> there is no likelihoode, that then they ſhall ſtande vs in ſtead that waye at all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, if it be true, that the creatures ſhall be eternall and mortall, by meanes of their reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, I woulde faine knowe then what priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege man ſhall haue, aboue the creatures, by that moſt reuerend, noble, yea miraculous worke of his riſing againe, and what difference there ſhall be, betweene him in his reſurrection, and them in their reſtauration? Surelie I can ſee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall or none at all. For if they will affirme, that the creature, haue for a time (as a man would ſay) forborne their immortalitie: hath not man as in reſpect of his bodie alſo, committed to the ground and diſſolued into duſt, and to which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the reſurrection dooth properly belong, borne that aſwel as they, and had a common lot and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that way forth, togither with them? The truth of this is ſo plaine, that beſides religion, reaſon it ſelfe wil eaſily perſuade it.</p>
            <p>In all that hitherto I haue deliuered touching this firſt point, I woulde willingly bee taken as I meane, I hauing putte downe the ſame, not as though I were of this minde, that the creatures after their reſtitution ſhould quicklie vaniſh away, though in my perſuaſion, there be greater like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoode of preſumption, in all ſhew of reaſon and truth, for this, than for that other, but thus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtandeth my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that foraſmuch as god
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6724:65"/>hath not reucaled in his word, for aught that I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowe or haue read in the ſame, what ſhall be the ſtate of his creatures, either durable or flitting, I will rather in all holy vnderſtanding according to ſobrietie, leaue the matter in his owne handes, to diſpoſe of them according to his owne good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than in preſuming <hi>to knovve aboue that vvhich is meete to knovve and vnderstand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.3.</note> determine either on the one ſide or on the other. And if this holie meaſure had beene faithfully obſerued in the days of our fathers, there had not ſo many ſubtil points entred into mens hearts and heads, as haue beene diſputed vppon, with, and againſt, as they ſay, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amongeſt the popiſh ſcholaſticall diuines, as they call them: or were it yet at this daie put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe as it ought to be, wee ſhoulde not haue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not onelie curious and vaine, but wicked and vngodly queſtions alſo, irreuerently toſſed too and fro, in the mouthes of prophane people, and that not onelie amongſt the vnlearned, but the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ones alſo, the more is the pittie, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I feare me is our ſinne.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing, touching the firſt point ſhortely, yet ſoundly, I truſt, deliuered my minde, and iuſtly cenſured it, if not condemned it, of the crime of curioſitie at the leaſt, as pronouncing and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more, than by the warrant of the worde men are able, I come to the ſecond matter, and giue a newe charge, or a freſh onſet vppon the ſame, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting it, yea battering it, and beating it downe to the ground as it were with a moſt righteous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of manifeſt falſhoode and vntruth. For to affirme, that we ſhall haue the vſe of the creatures,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6724:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>after their reſtitution, and our moſt glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſtandeth vppe directlie againſt the truth of Gods worde, which plainely aduoucheth, that in,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.30.</note> and after the reſurrection <hi>vvee shall be as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles of GOD in heauen, neither marrying vviues, nor hauing vviues bestovved in marriage vppon vs,</hi> nor do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuche actions of a naturall life, or vſing ſuche meanes for the vpholding of the ſame, as wee did while wee liued vppon the face of the earth, wee knowe, belceue, and confeſſe, that the Angelles are nowe of their owne nature, by that creation which they had from GOD, inuiſible, ſpirituall, and immortall ſubſtances: and this wee feare not to acknowledge, bicauſe wee haue learned it out of the written worde. Wee knowe againe on the other ſide, that viſible, corruptible, and bodilie ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance, can not bee fitte foode, for ſuche hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie and excellent creatures; reaſon it ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides religion or without it, hauing taught vs this, that there muſt be a certaine proportion, likelihode and conſent betweene the nature and diſpoſition of the foode, and the thing that is to be fedde or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed thereby. Very notable, as ſeemeth to mee, for this purpoſe, and the proofe of this point, is the ſpeech of the Angell that appeered to Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach and his wife, Sampſons parents, when they woulde haue ſtaied him, till they had made readie a kidde for him,<note place="margin">Indg. 13.16</note> the Angell anſwering thus: <hi>Though thou shouldest detaine me, yet vvoulde I not eate of thy meate: if thou vvilt prepare a burnt offring, thou shalt offer it vnto to he Lorde.</hi> As though hee ſhould ſay; there are but two endes of preparing and ſetting forth meate: the one, that it may bee eaten vp
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6724:66"/>after the manner of menne, the other, that it may bee dedicated vnto GOD, and vnto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
            <p>In the firſt conſideration, there is no neede to preſent it to mee, bicauſe I liue not by ſuch foode, this being rather my meate to nouriſhe mee, in all readie and holie obedience, to perfourme the thinges, that the Lorde himſelfe inioineth mee to doe, either for the good of his children, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the wicked. If thou offer it in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect, knowe that thou muſt offer it vppe vnto the Lorde onelie, bicauſe vnto him alone, and none other in heauen or earth, belong theſe ſolemne ſeruices and ſacrifices, as may appeere by preſcribing and commaunding the ſame in his lawe, there being not anie mention at all, of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſacrifices of any ſort whatſoeuer, to Angell, or other creatures.</p>
            <p>If anie will obiect againſt this truth, that great example in Geneſis the eighteenth chapter, where it is ſaide, that <hi>the Angels vvhome Abraham staied,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gene 18.8.</note> 
               <hi>did eate,</hi> I anſwere, that though in outward ſhewe and wordes, it ſeemeth to make againſt my aſſertion, that yet in the true and naturall meaning of it, it dooth no whit at all thwart it, but confirme it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>All the Scripture of GOD, which in the bare letter of it, containeth either an abſurditie in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or an error in religion, muſt of neceſſitie haue an other ſenſe than the wordes ſeeme to import, or elſe we ſhould make god the author of al wiſdome, <hi>yea the only vviſe God,</hi> and wiſdome it ſelfe,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> the father of follie, &amp; the word which is a moſt pure fountaine
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6724:67"/>of all truth and ſinceritie, a filthie puddle of error, corruption, and lies. And if for the ſaluing vp of mens ſlippes and ſliddes, in the words of their lips and mouthes, we wil admit ſo many goodly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as they themſelues or others for them can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe or bring, and yet perhappes fewe or none of them to purpoſe or effect, if they might be well ſcanned and weighed; why may wee not? naie whie ſhoulde wee not take thoſe aſſured groundes of chriſtian religion, that God hath reuealed in his worde (againſt which no exception can anie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way be put) and vſe them as meanes, not to free God from forgerie or deceit, for he is always iuſt and holy, though we be corrupt, nor to cleare his worde from error, which indeede in it ſelfe, is al plaineneſſe and truth, but as very good helpers and aiders, to cauſe vs in an vnderſtanding heart, to beholde, conceiue, and beleeue ſuch thinges as to the ſound knowledge wherof otherwiſe we could no manner of way attaine or reach? I ſay then, that for as muche as the place in the bare wordes of it, croſſeth the principles of chriſtian faith: and that for as much alſo as the doctrine of the worde tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, that ſuch celeſtiall ſubſtances, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither ſpirituall creatures, as Angelles can doe, no ſuch earthlie dutie, as is heere mentioned, nor performe the actions of a naturall bodie, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meaning of this place, muſt of neceſſitie be this, that for our weaknes ſake that is attributed to them, or ſpoken of them, which in deede and truth, and as in reſpect of their owne excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot be verified in them. For the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof alſo me thinketh this may ſomewhat
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6724:67"/>ſerue, namely, that as they ſeemed for the time, to haue the ſhape of men, and to take vppon them the proportion of their bodies, and yet were not men indeede, but alwayes verye Angelles, and heauenlie ſpirites; ſo they did ſometimes ſeeme to vſe the actions of humane life, and yet vſed them not at all.</p>
            <p>Indeede I both knowe and confeſſe, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scotus, and the popiſh ſchoole-men, are againſt me in this point, but Auguſtine, Peter Martyr, and other men alſo of ſingular iudgement, both newe and olde. Howbeit I reſt perſwaded that euen they themſelues, if they were liuing, and the godlie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſoeuer he be, will beare with me diſſenting from them vppon good reaſon, yea euen vppon their owne reaſon. For if they may ſay, and that vppon iuſte cauſe, that Angelles tooke vppon them the ſhape of mens bodies for a time, (not by any power in themſelues for that worke, but by Gods appointment thereto) and yet were not men, but Angelles continually, I hope that other men may ſay, and that vppon as good groundes, that they might ſeeme ſometimes to performe the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and yet not doe them indeed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto alſo I doe the more willingly incline, bicauſe I am ſure of this, that nothing here is to be feared as erroneous, or doubted as daungerous, vnleſſe ſome light-headed fellowe ſhoulde obiect and ſay, that this faining to do a thing, and not dooing of it, were euill. To whome for anſwere I ſay this much, that I hartily deſire all of that mind, to beware and take heed what they ſpeake in that behalfe, bicauſe thereby they ſhall not onlie accuſe thoſe creatures
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6724:68"/>of ſinne, whom the Lord hath freed from that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and the taint thereof, I meane the holie, bleſſed, and elect Angelles, but euen Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God himſelfe, of whome wee reade in the goſpell after Luke, that trauelling after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection toward Emaus with two of his diſciples, <hi>he made as though hee vvoulde haue gone further,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 24.28.</note> and yet offended not therein, bicauſe hee neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſinne,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.22.</note> 
               <hi>neither vvas there euer guile found in his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a worde to deliuer what I thinke; for anie man to conclude that euery fiction either in worde or deede were euill, ſhould be not onelie very hard and peremptorie, but vtterly falſe and vntrue. The parables that the prophets of God haue vſed, and particularly that of Nathan in the firſt of Samu. &amp; twelfe chap. verſ. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. and of Hoſ. 1. verſ. 2, 3, &amp;c. and of others, ſhould ſo be prooued falſhoode and lying, which we cannot rightly or ſafly affirme, for as much as they vſed them, by authoritie and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Lorde. And yet I minde not to tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate, much leſſe to allowe, of that wicked licenſe and diuelliſh libertie, that the praters and ianglers of our dayes take vnto themſelues in this behalfe, both by worde and writing. For I haue learned to put a difference betweene ſuche as Angelles and holy men haue by authoritie from GOD, with ſome glorie vnto his name, and good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and voide of oſtentation or of affection as in reſpect of themſelues vſed, and thoſe that prophane perſons doe printe and coine, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for to manifeſt their wittes, and ſometimes for to obtaine credite thereby, but alwayes with

Neither doth the Lorde heere onely obſerue this order, but in many other places of his worde, giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand, both how hard a thing it is, as in reſpect of our corruption, and howe neceſſarie for our good, to repreſſe and beate downe in vs, that great ouer-weening which wee haue of our ſelues; as for example wee ſee it vſed in Deuteronomie,<note place="margin">Deut. 31.1.

            <p>Laſtly, wee may heere plainely ſee, to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ioy and peace of our bodies and of our ſouls, into what great excellencie of glorie, GODS children at the reſurrection ſhall be aduanced, for the illuſtrating and inlarging whereof all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall then be renewed and reſtored, euen as they were at the beginning made alſo for them. And this ſhoulde teache vs all to ſpend the dayes of our pilgrimage here <hi>in feare and trembling,</hi> that at the length wee may, thorough the goodneſſe of GOD in his Chriſt, be gathered home into our eternall tabernacles, there to raigne with him for euer.</p>
            <p>He that will giue and gather any other, either ſenſe or doctrine, out of this place, than as before, may ſhew himſelfe to be drunken with vaine ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, yea drowned in them, but ſhal neuer attain <hi>to that edification vvhich is of God,</hi> and wherevnto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they that are of God ſhould ſtriue, ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all vaine iangling, and curious queſtions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, not determinable by the rule of the worde.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:6724:71"/>
            <p>Hitherto for this matter, which being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as before, let vs come to that verſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth of this text, wherein the Apoſtle affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which he had doone before, touching the groanings of the creatures, and the ſighs and ſobs (as it were) of the children of God. And yet this is no vaine tantologie or idle repetition, but a more vehement affirmation of that whiche went before, which may appeere in that the Apoſtle vſeth this terme <hi>(not onely)</hi> and a more plaine and particular declaration of that which he had ſomewhat darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed before, namely, in the 22. verſe, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>that the creatures vvith vs did groane and trauell in payne togither,</hi> not onelie ſhewing heere, what he meant by that terme <hi>(vs)</hi> which hee expoundeth in theſe words, <hi>vve vvhich haue receiued the first fruits of the ſpirite,</hi> but alſo what it is, <hi>that vvee both ſighe and vvayte for,</hi> to wit, our adoption, that is the full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation and declaration of it, which ſhall then indeede (and not before) bee perfectly accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. When that our bodies ſhall be raiſed againe out of the duſt of death, and vntied to their owne ſoules, and ſo wee both in bodie and ſoule made perfect partakers of eternall life and bleſſedneſſe But let vs more particularly examine the wordes, and obſerue ſome doctrines out of the ſame, that ſo alſo we may come to the end of this treatie.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>(And not only the creature)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To wit, groaneth and trauelleth in paine, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, verſe 23. vnderſtanding the worde Creature here as there. True it is, that the word <hi>(creature)</hi> is not in the Greeke text, but yet it is wel ſupplied, both by reſon he hadde made mention of it before
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6724:71"/>twice or thrice, and minding alſo by amplification to inlarge the point, by that terme <hi>(not onelie)</hi> hee ſheweth that that affection is not proper to them alone, but that the ſons and ſeruaunts of God haue it, in greater excellencie by much, than the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelues. If any man therfore ſhould not thinke well of laying that word to the reſt, he hath his anſwere before; and yet may the better beare it alſo, bicauſe it is doone for euidence and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſake. Neither ſhould any man thinke this ſhort kinde of ſpeaking ſtrange; ſith it is vſuall in our owne toong, and very rife and common with the Apoſtle, as in other his writings, ſo in this his epiſtle to the Romans, for proofe whereof the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reader may look vpon Rom. 5.3.11. Rom. 9.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But vve alſo</hi> I take it to be as much as if he ſhold ſay, euen we our ſelues do perform the ſelf-ſame du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty that the reſt of the creatures do, although (as was ſaid before) in a more excellent ſort and maner, &amp; that this ſhould be the Apoſtles meaning, we haue not onelie this reaſon for it, bicauſe they do it not by others, neither indeede can others beſides them performe it for them, but alſo bicauſe the Apoſtle himſelfe doth afterwards emphatically as wee ſaie repeate the ſame againe in this verſe, ſaying; euen we doe ſigh in our ſelues. By which alſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle woulde teache vs, both how neceſſary this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, and how carefull we our ſelues ſhoulde be to do the ſame. But alas wee are ſo farre off from the practiſe of it, that our thoughts are not buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it or anie ſuch other good matter, but rather as the Prophet ſaieth; <hi>Our hearts goeth after our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe.</hi>

            <p>Now whereas hee addeth <hi>the first fruits of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> wee are to knowe, that it is a metaphor bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the ceremoniall lawe.

From which wee
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6724:72"/>may learne, many good and profitable inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as firſt in that the firſt fruits of euerie thing were conſecrated to the Lorde, that therefore in the ſeruice of our GOD wee ſhoulde imploie, not onelie the meaneſt thinges that wee haue (a fault, as heeretofore, ſo nowe,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.8.9. &amp;c</note> too common in this vnthankefull worlde, either in contempt will yeelde GOD nothing, or in careleſneſſe offer him the woorſt of all the flocke) but euen the beſt wee poſſeſſe and inioye, if wee haue any thing better than an other, either within vs or without.

            <p>It followeth <hi>(euen vve doe ſigh in our ſelues.)</hi> He had ſpoken this before verſe. 22. ſauing that heere hee doth ſomwhat more largely affirme the ſame, there beeing this difference, further, that whereas there hee ſayed, the creatures together groaned with vs, heere he affirmeth, that the faithfull doe it among them ſelues, ſhewing thereby, that neither the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Gods worde, nor the inſtructions that God will haue vs fetch from his workes, are vnprofitable to his children, to whome they are directed, but ſerue to much good, &amp; ſtand in great vſe, as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good purpoſes generallye, ſo particularlye to bring them out of loue and liking with the pleaſurs and profits of this preſent euil world, and to make them earneſtlie to hunger and thirſt after eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bleſſedneſſe and euerlaſting life thorowe Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Euerie worde that the Apoſtle vſeth heere, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth

               <note place="margin">Philip. 3.1.</note> 
               <hi>to vvrite or ſpeake the ſame things vnto the people of GOD, ſpecially alſo ſith it is a ſure and profitable thing for them: neither that vve our ſelues should be negligent to put them alvvayes in remembrance of ſuch things,</hi>

               <hi>though they haue knovvledge, and be established in the preſent trueth.</hi> For beſides that wee forget the thinges that wee haue learned, we had neede to be ſtirred vp, in the things that we know,</p>
            <p>And whereas the Apoſtle addeth, that we <hi>do ſigh,</hi> we are to know, that he reherſeth this againe more fully to declare this feruent deſire that the godlye haue, yea the very ſens and feeling that is in them, not only of the miſeries and calamities of this life,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6724:75"/>but of the ioyes of heauen, and the hope of eternall ſaluation, which doth not onely cauſe him, to ſaye a deſire, but a ſighing, for where there is either a ſenſe of miſerie, or a feeling of mercie, there cannot but be both ſighes and groanes, to bee freed from the one, and to bee filled with the other. Me thinketh that that which the apoſtle writeth in another place is fitte for the expoſition of this point, he telleth vs, <hi>that if our earthlie houſe of this tabernacle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.1.2. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>vvere once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, vvee haue a building giuen vs of God, that is an houſe, not made vvith handes, but eternall in the heauens: for vvhich alſo vvee ſigh, deſiring to be cloathed vvith our houſe vvhich is from heauen, becauſe that if vve be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vve shall not be found naked. For in deede vvee that are in this tabernacle ſigh, and are burdened, becauſe vvee vvould not be vncloathed, but vvould be cloathed vppon, that immortalitie might be ſvvallovved vp of life.</hi> What can be more plaine? doth he not in euident tearms affirme, that the faithful are ſo far off, from ſticking faſt to this earthlie tabernacle, that they doe not onely wiſh to bee remooued from it, but euen as a man would ſaye, with ſighes and ſobs deſire rather that heauenlie tabernacle. Certainely he vſeth the verie ſelfe-ſame woords in both places, and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the ſelfe-ſame matter, and therefore good reaſon, that one of them ſhould ſerue for the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expoſition of the other. The Apoſtle yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge treating of this doctrine in ſeuerall places of his Epiſtles, to ſeuerall people, teaching vs, that it is and ought to be a common doctrine for the whole Church, and for euerie member of it, and accordinglie to bee propounded,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.19.</note> as moſt fitte and comfortable for them, <hi>for if heere bee our hope onelye,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6724:75"/>vvee are of all men the most miſerable:</hi> as who beſides the common calamities of our naturall life, are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the malice of the wicked, <hi>for gods ſake,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſayth further that the faythfull doe after this ſorte, ſighe and ſobbe <hi>in them ſelues,</hi> not meaning therby only that theſe ſighinges are ſecret and inwarde alone, though that no doubte be ſome parte of his meaning, and the experience that the godly finde in them ſelues, ſheweth this to be moſt true, but alſo that they are owtwarde, yet ſo as they doe proceede from the bottome of theyr hearts, and as a man would ſaye, from the verie bowelles of their ſoules. By which the Apoſtle would teach vs, what earneſt longing as it were there ought to bee in all of gods children, for the manifeſtation of that time, wherein they ſhall not onelie bee freed from all miſeries, but made pertakers of all felicitie, and eternall bleſſedneſſe. Yea, the Appoſtle woulde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs, that wee ſhould not onelie ſtriue to haue this effectuall feeling within, a matter whiche no doubt maie giue much peace to our hearts, becauſe the inward comfort and ioy of the ſpirite is moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, and full of heauenly delight, as which hath euen ſo rapt and rauiſhed manie of the ſaintes and ſeruaunts of GOD, in this life, that it hath made them, to forget as a man woulde ſaie, them-ſelues, and all the pleaſures and profits of this world what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, yea and willinglie to forgo them all, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that we ſhould according to the meaſure of grace
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6724:76"/>receiued, labor to laie it out, and to expreſſe it ſo in our wordes, countenaunces, deedes, and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that other men by our examples, may be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to the like felowlike feeling, &amp; to the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and declaring of the ſame towardes others, as they haue found and ſeene in others ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them ſelues. Prouided alwaies that yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we do both the one and the other in ſome meaſure of a ſounde minde not making vaine ſhewes, as the maner of hipocrites is, of ſuch things as we haue not within vs in deed, for that is nothing elſe, but daliance with the Lorde, and deceitfulnes towardes our ſelues and others, but hauing that in truth and effect, namelie, that we pretend outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, which alſo is a notable meane, to approoue the feeling of our ſoules to be from God, that ſo alſo we our ſelues maie therein be comforted, and other men, according to the good will and pleaſure of God bee greatlie profited. And all theſe doctrines, and particulerlie this laſt, doeth rightlie ariſe out of theſe wordes of the Apoſtle, <hi>doe ſigh in our ſelues,</hi> that is to ſaie, inwardlie and outwardlie, earneſtlie alſo, and from the bottome of good heartes, wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme this duetie, and therefore others by our examples ſhould labour to doe the like.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>(vvayting for the adoption)</hi> vnder that tearme of waiting, hee expreſſeth the patient aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the faithfull haue, noting thereby that they doe not earneſtlie, wiſhe for it, which was expreſſed before, in the tearmes of ſighing and grooning but that in patience <hi>poſſeſſing their ovvne ſoules,</hi> according to the commaundement of Chriſt, they doe with quietneſſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pirite, and comfort of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6724:76"/>heart, expect not onely the thing it ſelfe, but the time alſo wherin that ſhalbe diſcloſed, not murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt GOD, though it pleaſe him to delaye the fruition of that, whiche they moſte delight in and long after.</p>
            <p>And this ſhould teach vs in all things generally, and particularlie in this, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of heere, to be ſo conſourmed vnto the obedience of Gods will, that wee can with earneſtneſſe and an vnfeigned minde, ſaie, as our Sauiour teacheth vs; <hi>Thy vvill be done, in earth as it is in heauen,</hi> vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our hope in this, that if GOD yeeld not at the firſt, yet we will in chriſtian patience attend his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and good pleaſure alſo, perſwading our ſelues heereof, that they whenſoeuer his graces come, they ſhall come in a time moſt acceptable, and beſt euen for vs, (though perhaps wee our ſelues thinke not ſo) becauſe he that knoweth what is better for vs then wee our ſelues, knoweth alſo what tyme they are moſte fitte for vs, from whence alſo wee ſhoulde learne, to ſhake and caſt from vs, theſe curſed corruptions that clyng vnto vs, and doe dyrectlie fight againſte the trueth of this doctrine: ſometimes wee ſetting GOD a tyme, which in deede ſauoureth of intollerable preſumption, preſcribing to him that is LORDE ouer all: and ſometymes againe not ſo reuerentlye eſteeming his benefites as wee ſhoulde, becauſe wee haue them not, when wee our ſelues woulde, which alſo bewrayeth wonderfull waiewardneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeneſſe in vs, wee practiſing and approouing that againſt our father and Lorde, which wee will tollerate, in our children and ſeruantes towards vs.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6724:77"/>Let vs learne rather to be ſo conformed vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of gods wil, that whether we haue his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges preſentlie powred forth vpon vs, ot that they be for a while wiih holden from vs, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we wil both with the one and the other be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie well content.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the Apoſtle vſeth the worde <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we are to ſee what hee meaneth by that. It is a woorde of the ciuill lawe, and whereof they haue a little in the inſtitutes, by which they note, that choiſe that a man maketh of ſome one (who is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before the choiſe made deſtitute and in ſome miſerie) to be vnto him as a ſonne or childe, if hee haue none of his owne, or elſe if he haue of his own (for euen ſuch alſo might addopt) to adde him vnto that number, and to prouide for him, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not in ſo high a degree, as for a naturall ſonne, yet verie plentifullie and liberallie, not onely as in reſpect of that poore eſtate wherein the partie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted was before, but to preferre him before all his ſeruaunts, how tenderlie ſo euer he loued them, or prouided carefullie for them: ſo that the adopted children, ſeemed to be in a meane eſtate betweene the naturall ſonnes and daughters, and theſe that were in the condition of ſeruaunts. This tearme the Apoſtle taketh and applieth to Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and namelie to note out, the free choiſe of god, adopting and taking vs vnto him ſelfe then, when we were in moſt extreame miſerie, a large and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcourſe whereof we may read Ezechi, 16-3.4.5. &amp;c. He not onely chooſing vs vnto him ſelfe as ſeruaunts, but as ſonnes, whoſe ſonnes (though we be not by nature and ſubſtance, for ſo Ieſus Chriſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6724:77"/>
               <hi>is the onelie ſonne of God, begotten of the ſubstance of the father before all vvorldes,</hi> whereas we are contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>(by nature the children of vvrath.)</hi> Yet are wee ſo by the grace of adoption, by which alſo wee haue ſuch priuiledge that we are not aduaunced into <hi>the honour of ſonnes onely, but of heires alſo, yea heires of God, and fellovve heires annexed vvith our Sauiour Christ</hi> as this our Apoſtle declareth in this eight Chapter to the Romans. All which ſhould teache vs as on the one ſide, to ſee our owne miſerie and wretchednes, that ſo it may be a profitable meane continually to humble vs before our God, ſo on the other ſide, alſo to looke vpon the great loue and ſinguler fauour of God, in this free choiſe of vs vnto himſelfe, that ſo it maie effectuallie ſtirre vs vp, to walke worthie of ſo great grace, making our election ſure in our ſelues, and to others alſo by good workes.</p>
            <p>He addeth <hi>(euen the redemption of our bodies)</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were more plainelie what hee ment by the true <hi>adoption,</hi> to witte, not onelie that free grace of God in chooſing vs to be his ſonnes and ſeruaunts, but euen the full manifeſtation and perfection of it, yea euen the enioying of the fruit of it that is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of our ſoules in the daie of Chriſt, yea the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of our whole man in that ſame great daie. But perhaps ſome will ſaie here is no mention made of the ſoule. What then? the certaintie of that was ſo plaine and euident that the Apoſtle needed not to labour in the proofe of it: that that ſeemed more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulte and hard to beleeue, as the reſtauration of the bodies of the faithfull (of which ſome had bene deuoured by wild beaſtes, other ſome conſumed in the fire, other ſome ſwallowed vppe of the ſea &amp;c,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6724:78"/>which how they ſhould be brought againe, ſeemeth verie hard, if not impoſſible, ſpeciallie to fleſhe and bloud) was moſt of all to be traueiled in; He putting therefore one part for the whole, dealeth moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the part, that ſeemed to haue moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in it, ſpecially for the reſtauration of it.</p>
            <p>But ſome man will thinke againe, that this ſpech is preiudiciall to the death of Chriſt, who by that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his body offred once for al vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, hath perfectly performed the worke of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both of our ſoules and bodies. We anſwere, that though that be moſt true that is put down, that yet for all that, wee enioye not the full benefite thereof in this life, neither in deed ſhall, vntill that the Lord hauing deliuered vs, from this baſe and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate wherein we are, haue by the riſing againe from the dead, made vs perfect pertakers of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall glorie. This perfection of our bleſſednes the ſcripture calleth in manie places by ſundrie names, as ſometimes our quickning, our inheritance, our glorie,<note place="margin">Philip. 5.21.</note> ſometimes our changing, as <hi>Phillippians</hi> 5.21. where the Apoſtle telleth vs, <hi>that Christ shall change the bodies of our baſenes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.53.</note> 
               <hi>and make them like vnto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bodie:</hi> and in the Corinthians alſo, where hee nameth it, <hi>changing from a fleshlie and earthlie conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to a ſpirituall and heauenly state, that that vvas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mortall, being cloathed vvith immortalitie.</hi> By all which you may ſee, that wee doe not onelie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, as ſome do, if the ſundring of the ſoule from the bodie onelie (which wee confeſſe to bee in part the Apoſtles meaning, but yet not his whole mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) but alſo of the glorious reſtitution of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as which doth not onelye beſt agree, with the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6724:78"/>groundes of chriſtian religion, but moſt aptlie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for the Apoſtles purpoſe in this place, as who dealeth here not ſo much with the diſſolution of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as with the reſtitution of them to that eternall immortalitie, that ſhall free them from duſt and powder, and ſet them in eſtate of eternall incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In a word to conclude this holie treatie; wee ſee what the Apoſtles purpoſe is, namely, to teache the people of God to long and ſigh after their life, that is prepared and laid vppe for them in heauen. The creatures in their kinde do it, therefore ought wee much more that profeſſe faith and godlines doe it; who beſides their example haue many other means ſet before vs to effect this worke in vs; as the earneſt and often admonition of the worde, teaching vs, <hi>to vſe this vvorld, as though vve vſed it not,</hi> the manifold afflictions, that both in bodie and ſoule we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto in this life, the great and greeuous perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that we ſuſtaine for our holie profeſſion at the handes of the wicked, the Lord at that time and not before fullie manifeſting his righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>in recompenſing to them that trouble vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 1.6.7.8.</note> 
               <hi>tribulation and to vs that are troubled, reſt vvith the faithfull, vvhen the Lord Ieſus shall shevv him ſelfe from heauen vvith his mightie Angels, in flaming fire, rendring vengeance vnto them that do not knovv God.</hi>
